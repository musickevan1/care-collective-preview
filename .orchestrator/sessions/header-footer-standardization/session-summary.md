# Header/Footer Standardization - Prompt Builder Session

> Generated by @prompt-builder on December 30, 2025

---

## Original Request

User requested an orchestration prompt for executing the "Header/Footer Standardization Plan" using the @orchestrator agent.

---

## Refined Understanding

The user has a detailed plan (saved at `.prompts/header-footer-standardization.md`) that needs to be converted into a comprehensive orchestration prompt that the @orchestrator agent can execute.

**Key Requirements:**
- Create `PublicPageLayout` component with navy header
- Update 10 public pages to use this layout
- Add active state highlighting in navigation
- Include footer on all pages
- Standardize background colors
- All work on `feature/public-layout-standardization` branch
- Merge via pull request (not direct to main)

**Files Affected:**
- 1 new file: `components/layout/PublicPageLayout.tsx`
- 10 modified files: Various public pages (about, resources, contact, help, privacy-policy, terms, login, signup, waitlist, access-denied)

---

## Target Agent

`@orchestrator` - This task requires:
- Multi-file coordination (11 files across 10 different directories)
- Parallel execution opportunities (research, page updates)
- Component creation and integration
- Comprehensive testing across multiple pages
- Git workflow management with branch strategy
- Session documentation

---

## Generated Orchestration Prompt

**Location:** `.orchestrator/sessions/header-footer-standardization/orchestration-prompt.md`

**Structure:**
1. **Task Overview** - Summary of what needs to be done
2. **Phase 0** - Branch setup and research (5 parallel tasks)
3. **Phase 1** - Create `PublicPageLayout` component
4. **Phase 2** - Update 6 public content pages (parallel)
5. **Phase 3** - Update 2 auth pages (parallel)
6. **Phase 4** - Update 2 special pages (parallel)
7. **Phase 5** - Testing and verification
8. **Phase 6** - Git workflow and PR creation

**Key Features of the Prompt:**
- Detailed specifications for `PublicPageLayout` component
- Code patterns and examples for page updates
- Comprehensive testing checklist
- Git workflow with explicit branch strategy
- Critical constraints (what NOT to do)
- Design token references
- Success metrics
- Session documentation requirements

**Parallelization Opportunities Identified:**
- Phase 0: 5 research tasks (homepage header, SiteFooter, public pages, MobileNav, PlatformLayout)
- Phase 2: 6 public content pages (about, resources, contact, help, privacy-policy, terms)
- Phase 3: 2 auth pages (login, signup)
- Phase 4: 2 special pages (waitlist, access-denied)

---

## Session Directory Created

**Location:** `.orchestrator/sessions/header-footer-standardization/`

**Files to be created by @orchestrator:**
1. `context.md` - Original plan and research findings
2. `02-design.md` - PublicPageLayout design decisions
3. `03-implementation.md` - Implementation notes and challenges
4. `04-tests.md` - Test results and verification
5. `05-review.md` - Final quality review

---

## How to Execute

### Option 1: Direct Invocation
Invoke @orchestrator agent with the orchestration prompt:

```
@orchestrator

Please execute the comprehensive orchestration plan for standardizing headers and footers across all public pages.

The full orchestration prompt is located at:
`.orchestrator/sessions/header-footer-standardization/orchestration-prompt.md`

Execute all phases (0 through 6), leveraging parallelization opportunities as indicated.
Document all work in the session directory.
```

### Option 2: Read Prompt First
```bash
cat .orchestrator/sessions/header-footer-standardization/orchestration-prompt.md
```

Then invoke @orchestrator with any specific instructions or context additions.

## What @orchestrator Will Do

1. **Phase 0**: Create branch and research existing components in parallel
2. **Phase 1**: Build the `PublicPageLayout` component
3. **Phase 2**: Update 6 public content pages (about, resources, contact, help, privacy-policy, terms)
4. **Phase 3**: Update 2 auth pages (login, signup)
5. **Phase 4**: Update 2 special pages (waitlist, access-denied)
6. **Phase 5**: Comprehensive testing (automated + manual)
7. **Phase 6**: Git workflow (commit, push, create PR)

The orchestrator will:
- Leverage parallel execution for efficiency
- Document all work in session files
- Follow all CLAUDE.md guidelines
- Ensure accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Test thoroughly before committing
- Create pull request for review (NOT direct merge to main)

---

## Critical Constraints Communicated

The orchestration prompt includes explicit "DO NOT VIOLATE" sections:

1. **Branch Strategy:**
   - ❌ NEVER commit to main
   - ❌ NEVER push to main
   - ✅ ALL work on feature branch
   - ✅ Merge via pull request only

2. **Code Quality:**
   - ❌ NO files over 500 lines
   - ❌ NO `JSX.Element` - use `ReactElement`
   - ❌ NO ESLint warnings
   - ✅ WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility

3. **Content Preservation:**
   - ❌ DO NOT modify existing page content
   - ❌ DO NOT change form logic
   - ✅ ONLY wrapper/structure changes

4. **Testing:**
   - ❌ DO NOT skip manual testing
   - ❌ DO NOT merge without PR review
   - ✅ ALL automated tests must pass

---

## Success Criteria

The project will be complete when:
1. ✅ `PublicPageLayout` component created and working
2. ✅ All 10 public pages use `PublicPageLayout`
3. ✅ Navy header appears on all pages
4. ✅ Navigation works with active state highlighting
5. ✅ Footer appears on all public pages
6. ✅ Auth buttons display correctly (both states)
7. ✅ Mobile navigation works on all pages
8. ✅ Background is consistent (`bg-background`)
9. ✅ All automated tests pass
10. ✅ Manual testing checklist complete
11. ✅ Pull request created and approved
12. ✅ Changes merged to main via PR
