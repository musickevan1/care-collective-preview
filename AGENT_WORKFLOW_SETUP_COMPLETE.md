## 🎯 Quick Start - How to Use

### For Simple Bug Fixes:
```
"Fix the typo on the help request page"
→ Claude will automatically use: Coordinator → Quick Explore → Fix → Test → Deploy
```

### For New Features:
```
"Add a feature to let users rate help exchanges"
→ Claude will automatically use the full 9-phase workflow
→ Includes privacy planning, accessibility, comprehensive testing
```

### For Security/Privacy Features:
```
"Add encryption to the messaging system"
→ Claude will automatically use: Privacy Planning + Privacy Audit (mandatory)
→ Extra verification for PII protection
```

## 🎓 Key Workflow Features

### 1. **Automatic Agent Coordination**
- Coordinator agent analyzes your request
- Selects appropriate agent chain automatically
- Launches parallel agents for efficiency

### 2. **Domain-Specific Agents**
- **Privacy & Security**: For contact exchange, messaging
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance checks
- **Database**: Supabase migrations, RLS policies
- **Mobile**: Responsive design, touch targets

### 3. **Quality Gates (BLOCKING)**
All must pass before deployment:
- ✅ TypeScript: 0 errors
- ✅ ESLint: 0 warnings
- ✅ Tests: All pass + 80% coverage
- ✅ Build: Successful
- ✅ Privacy: No exposed PII, consent enforced
- ✅ Accessibility: No WCAG 2.1 AA violations

### 4. **User Consent Protocol**
Claude will ALWAYS ask permission before:
- ✋ Git commits
- ✋ Production deployments (`npx vercel --prod`)
- ✋ PR merges

### 5. **Context Budget Management**
- Total: ~200k tokens per session
- Exploration: 15-30%
- Planning: 15-35%
- Production: 45-75%
- Verification: 5-10%
- Deployment: 5-10%

## 📊 Workflow Examples

### Example 1: Contact Exchange Feature
```
User: "Add a contact exchange feature with privacy consent"

Coordinator:
  ✓ Identifies: New feature, privacy-critical
  ✓ Agent chain: Full workflow with Privacy agents
  ✓ Creates TODO list

Exploration (Parallel):
  ✓ Domain Explore: Find existing contact patterns
  ✓ Database Explore: Check contact_exchanges table
  ✓ Dependencies Explore: Find Zod schemas

Planning:
  ✓ Architecture: Plan Server/Client components
  ✓ Privacy: Design explicit consent flow
  ✓ Database: Plan RLS policies
  ✓ Accessibility: Plan ARIA labels, 44px targets
  ✓ Tests: Define test cases for consent flow

Production:
  ✓ Database: Create migration with RLS
  ✓ Schema: Add Zod validation for consent
  ✓ Component: Build form with consent checkbox
  ✓ API: Implement server action
  ✓ Privacy: Add audit trail logging
  ✓ Tests: Write 15 tests (85% coverage)

Verification (Parallel):
  ✓ Type check: Passed
  ✓ Tests: 15/15 passed, 85% coverage
  ✓ Build: Successful
  ✓ Privacy Audit: No exposed PII ✅
  ✓ Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA ✅
  ✓ Mobile: Responsive ✅

Deployment:
  ✓ Ask user: "Ready to commit. May I proceed?"
  ✓ Git commit with descriptive message
  ✓ Ask user: "Ready to deploy. May I proceed?"
  ✓ npx vercel --prod
  ✓ Verify production deployment

Handoff:
  ✓ Update PROJECT_STATUS.md
  ✓ Generate /compact summary
  ✓ Document lessons learned
```

### Example 2: Simple Bug Fix
```
User: "Fix the spelling error on the dashboard"

Coordinator:
  ✓ Identifies: Simple bug fix
  ✓ Agent chain: Quick explore → Fix → Verify → Deploy

Exploration (Quick):
  ✓ Domain Explore: Find dashboard component

Production:
  ✓ Fix typo in component
  ✓ Update test if needed

Verification:
  ✓ Type check: Passed
  ✓ Tests: Passed
  ✓ Build: Successful

## 🔧 MCP Tools Integration

The workflow automatically uses these MCP servers:

### **Supabase MCP**
- Exploration: `list_tables`, `execute_sql`
- Production: `apply_migration`
- Verification: `get_advisors` (security)

### **GitHub MCP**
- Deployment: `create_pull_request`, `merge_pull_request`
- Review: `request_copilot_review`

### **Playwright MCP**
- E2E Testing: `browser_navigate`, `browser_click`, `browser_fill_form`
- Mobile Testing: `browser_resize`, `browser_snapshot`
- Production Verify: Test live production URL

### **A11y MCP**
- Accessibility Audit: `scan_page` (WCAG violations)

### **Lighthouse MCP** (Future)
- Performance: `get_performance_score`, `get_core_web_vitals`

## 📖 How to Read the Documentation

## 🎯 Next Steps

### For Your Next Task:
1. Simply describe what you want to do
2. Claude will automatically:
   - Analyze the request (Coordinator)
   - Select the appropriate agent chain
   - Create a TODO list
   - Execute phases sequentially
   - Ask for permission before commits/deployment

### To Generate Session Summaries:
Type `/compact` at any time to get a comprehensive session summary with:
- Primary request and intent
- Technical concepts used
- Files modified with code snippets
- Database changes
- Quality compliance checks
- Deployment status
- Next steps

## 💡 Key Principles

1. **KISS + YAGNI**: Simple tasks use simple workflows
2. **Privacy First**: All PII features require Privacy agent
3. **Accessibility Non-Negotiable**: All UI requires Accessibility agent
4. **Quality Gates**: No deployment without passing all gates
5. **User Consent**: Always ask before commits/deploys
6. **Parallel Efficiency**: Run independent agents together
7. **Context Budget**: Monitor and optimize token usage

## 🚀 Benefits

✅ **Consistency**: Every feature follows the same process
✅ **Quality**: Built-in privacy, accessibility, security checks
✅ **Efficiency**: Parallel execution where possible
✅ **Transparency**: Clear TODO lists and progress tracking
✅ **Safety**: User consent before commits/deploys
✅ **Documentation**: Automatic status updates and summaries
✅ **Context-Aware**: Optimizes token usage per phase
✅ **Domain-Specific**: Tailored to Care Collective's needs

## 📞 Using the Workflow

Just start your next conversation with any request:
- "Add a notification system for help requests"
- "Fix the mobile navigation menu"
- "Improve the accessibility of the signup form"
- "Add encryption to messages"

Claude will automatically apply the agent workflow system! 🎉
