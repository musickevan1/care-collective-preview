## Original Idea

Implement client feedback from Dr. Maureen Templeman's January 1, 2026 email for the CARE Collective website (swmocarecollective.org). The feedback includes typography improvements, content corrections, dashboard enhancements, and social media integration.

## Refined Understanding

The CARE Collective website needs 11 targeted updates across 10 files:

1. **Design System**: Add teal color (#3D4F52) to Tailwind, establish global typography scale with larger sizes and better contrast
2. **Hero Section**: Increase "Southwest Missouri" text size, darken body text on cream background
3. **Homepage About**: Add "Founder" title under Maureen portrait, fix "Together, we are making caregiving sustainable" text size, reorder mobile layout for founder photo
4. **Join Page**: Change subheading from "Create your account to start helping your community" to "Create an account below"
5. **Resources Page**: Center-align section subheadings, update hospice resource title to "Hospice Foundation for Outreach"
6. **Dashboard**: Increase all card heading sizes (text-lg → text-xl)
7. **Requests Page**: Update "Offer to Help" form text sizes and placeholder to "Hi. I think I can help! I am available most days after 5 PM"
8. **Admin Panel**: Add email address display for pending membership applications
9. **Footers**: Add Facebook icon linking to https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61582852599484 to both SiteFooter and PublicPageFooter

All changes are visual/content only with no breaking changes.

## Target Agent

`@orchestrator` - This is a complex, multi-file implementation spanning UI, content, and component updates. Orchestrator can parallelize independent changes across multiple agents.

### Requirements:
- **Create branch first:** `git checkout -b feature/client-feedback-jan2026`
- **Commit all changes** to the feature branch
- **DO NOT push to main** - All work stays on feature branch for review
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Use CSS variables from tailwind.config.ts when available
- Ensure mobile responsiveness is maintained
- Keep accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- No breaking changes to functionality

### Testing:
After implementation, verify:
- TypeScript compiles without errors (`npm run type-check`)
- Linting passes (`npm run lint`)
- Build succeeds (`npm run build`)
- Typography scales correctly across breakpoints
- Mobile layout changes work as expected
