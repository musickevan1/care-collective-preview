# Prompt: Homepage Client Updates

> Generated by @prompt-builder on 2025-12-20

## Original Idea
Implement client-requested changes to the homepage incrementally, avoiding the previous issue where orchestrator runs created completely different/broken homepages.

## Refined Understanding
The client provided detailed feedback in `docs/documents/home-page-content.md` with specific text changes, deletions, and one structural change (3-box layout). Previous orchestrator attempts failed by rewriting everything at once. The solution is to break changes into small, atomic subtasks that preserve existing code structure.

## Target Agent
`@orchestrator` - Requires coordination across multiple small changes with careful sequencing to avoid breaking the page. Can assign individual tasks to `@frontend-engineer` agents while ensuring each change is atomic and tested.

# Homepage Client Updates - Incremental Implementation

## CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR ORCHESTRATOR

**Problem Context**: Previous attempts created completely broken homepages by rewriting everything at once. 

**Required Approach**:
1. Break this into SMALL, ATOMIC subtasks (one change per task)
2. Each subtask must PRESERVE existing code structure and styling
3. Only modify what is explicitly listed - do NOT refactor or "improve" surrounding code
4. Test after each change before proceeding
5. If a change seems risky, do it in isolation

**Reference Files**:
- Current homepage: `app/page.tsx` (454 lines)
- Client requirements: `docs/documents/home-page-content.md`
- Existing components: `components/Hero.tsx`, `components/LandingSection.tsx`

## SUCCESS CRITERIA
- [ ] Each task completed without breaking existing functionality
- [ ] No TypeScript errors
- [ ] Mobile responsive maintained
- [ ] Accessibility preserved (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- [ ] Visual consistency with existing design system
- [ ] All existing navigation/links still work

---

## Context Notes
- Client document uses strikethrough (`~~deleted~~`) and `[bracketed instructions]` to mark changes
- "Kinds of Help" categories are STATIC TEXT - intentionally different from database categories (groceries, transport, household, medical, other)
- Dr. Templeman's photo file not yet provided - use placeholder
- Footer tagline should reference MSU and Southern Gerontological Society grant
- Previous orchestrator failures were caused by wholesale rewrites - atomic changes are essential
