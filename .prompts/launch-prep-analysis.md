# Prompt: Launch Preparation Analysis & Implementation Plan

> Generated by @prompt-builder on December 29, 2025

## Original Idea

Create an in-depth analysis of the current state of the Care Collective project and develop an extensive plan to prepare the platform for launch. Go through all documentation, client emails, and planning files to determine what has been done and what still needs to be done. Focus on polishing UI/UX, backend database schemas, code files, and existing features. Do not add new features that are not in the launch plans. Create a comprehensive todo task list for getting the platform launch-ready ASAP.

**Specific Issues to Address:**
1. Remove CARE logo from hero section (doesn't fit right)
2. Profile page touch-up: caregiver situation breadcrumbs suggestion text in textbox, remove "supporting two young children as a single parent" - keep only first option
3. Dashboard page: make "Your Requests" box same height as the two boxes next to it
4. Help requests page: fix advanced filter feature - when switching to urgency level, the Sort order dropdown should change to "Most urgent" and "Least urgent"
5. Messages page: first-time tutorial is very glitchy and needs significant improvement
6. Verify notifications system is functional
7. Check functionality and fix admin tools (CMS)

## Refined Understanding

**Context from Documentation:**
- Launch Date: January 1, 2026
- Current Status: Phase 2 Complete + Client Alignment Complete
- Overall Platform Readiness: 72/100 (72%) according to LAUNCH_PREPARATION_PLAN.md
- Phase 3 (Production Readiness) is 0% complete

**Completed Work:**
- All core features implemented (user auth, help requests, messaging, contact exchange, admin panel)
- Email notification system (5 types via Resend)
- Privacy dashboard (GDPR-ready)
- Client alignment phases 1-4 complete (branding, landing page, individual pages, email cleanup)
- 80%+ test coverage maintained
- WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance

**What Still Needs Completion (from launch plan):**
1. Performance optimization (Lighthouse 90+ targets)
2. Security hardening (OWASP compliance)
3. Deployment & monitoring setup
4. Legal document finalization
5. Admin account setup

**Specific UI/UX Issues Identified:**
- Hero section CARE logo visual issues
- Profile page caregiver situation textbox cleanup
- Dashboard request box height inconsistency
- Help requests filter sorting logic issues
- Messages tutorial/empty state glitches

## Target Agent

`@orchestrator` - This is a complex, multi-faceted analysis and implementation task that spans UI polish, UX improvements, verification of existing systems, and coordination across multiple areas. The orchestrator should spawn parallel agents for different focus areas and manage the overall launch prep workflow.

## Prompt

### Mission
Analyze the Care Collective platform's current state and create a comprehensive, prioritized implementation plan to achieve launch readiness by January 1, 2026. Your goal is to polish existing features, fix known issues, verify system functionality, and prepare the platform for production launch - WITHOUT adding new features outside the existing launch scope.

### Phase 1: Discovery & Analysis

Before creating any implementation plan, you MUST thoroughly analyze the current state:

#### 1.1 Codebase Analysis
- Review `docs/launch-2026/LAUNCH_PREPARATION_PLAN.md` for launch readiness assessment
- Review `docs/launch-2026/MASTER_PLAN.md` for phased approach and success criteria
- Review `PROJECT_STATUS.md` for current platform health
- Review `docs/client/` for client feedback, requirements, and alignment notes
- Review existing test reports in `docs/launch-2026/` (E2E tests, phase completion summaries)

#### 1.2 UI/UX Audit - Specific Issues to Investigate
For each issue, locate the relevant code and understand the current implementation:

**Issue 1: Hero Section CARE Logo**
- Locate: Homepage hero section component
- File likely in: `app/page.tsx` or `components/` related to landing page
- Task: Remove or reposition the CARE logo if it "doesn't fit right"
- Context: Client alignment phase 2 already updated hero with CARE acronym

**Issue 2: Profile Page - Caregiver Situation Textbox**
- Locate: Profile edit page/form component
- File likely in: `app/profile/` or `components/profile/`
- Task: Remove "supporting two young children as a single parent" from suggestion text, keep only first option
- Current behavior: Textbox has suggestion text/breadcrumbs that should be simplified

**Issue 3: Dashboard Request Box Height**
- Locate: Dashboard page component
- File likely in: `app/dashboard/` or `components/dashboard/`
- Task: Make "Your Requests" box same height as adjacent boxes (likely "Active Requests" and "Messages" or similar)
- Check: CSS/flexbox/grid layout for height consistency

**Issue 4: Help Requests - Advanced Filter Sorting**
- Locate: Help requests listing page with advanced filter
- File likely in: `app/requests/` or `components/help-requests/`
- Current bug: When switching filter to "urgency level", Sort order dropdown still shows generic options
- Expected: Should show "Most urgent" and "Least urgent" when filtering by urgency
- Task: Implement conditional dropdown options based on selected filter type

**Issue 5: Messages Tutorial/Empty State**
- Locate: Messages page component
- File likely in: `app/messages/` or `components/messaging/`
- Task: Investigate first-time user tutorial that is "very glitchy"
- Check: Empty states, onboarding flows, tutorial overlays
- Note: This was marked as "client top priority" in Phase 2 documentation

**Issue 6: Notifications System Verification**
- Verify the email notification system is fully functional:
  - Check `lib/notifications/` or similar for notification implementation
  - Verify 5 notification types: waitlist confirmation, approval, rejection, status change, help offer
  - Test sending test notifications if possible
  - Review Resend integration and API key configuration
  - Check for any errors in notification delivery

**Issue 7: Admin Tools (CMS) Functionality**
- Locate: Admin panel components
- File likely in: `app/admin/` or `components/admin/`
- Task: Test all admin functionalities:
  - User management (approve/reject waitlist, view profiles)
  - Content moderation capabilities
  - CMS tools for managing content
  - Any dashboard widgets or analytics
- Document any issues or missing functionality

#### 1.3 Documentation Review
- Identify all completed phases and their deliverables
- Cross-reference with current codebase to verify implementation
- Note any gaps between documented completion and actual implementation
- Review client feedback for any unresolved items

### Phase 2: Comprehensive Todo Task List

For each task, document:
- File(s) to modify
- Specific change required
- Testing approach
- Priority (critical/high/medium/low)
- Estimated effort

### Phase 3: Implementation Planning

Create an implementation schedule that:

1. **Prioritizes by Launch Impact**
   - Critical: Issues affecting user experience or core functionality
   - High: Polish items that significantly improve UX
   - Medium: Nice-to-have improvements
   - Low: Can defer to post-launch

2. **Estimates Effort**
   - Provide time estimates for each task
   - Identify dependencies between tasks
   - Flag any tasks requiring client input/approval

3. **Creates Milestones**
   - Day 1: Critical fixes
   - Day 2: System verification and high-priority polish
   - Day 3: Performance, accessibility, final polish
   - Launch Day: Final verification and deployment

### Phase 4: Execution Approach

For this analysis, you should:
1. **NOT execute the fixes** - create the comprehensive plan only
2. **Spawn research agents** to investigate each area in parallel
3. **Document findings** in `.orchestrator/sessions/launch-prep-analysis/`
4. **Create detailed task specifications** ready for implementation
5. **Provide clear file paths and change descriptions** for each task

### Deliverables

Create a comprehensive document `.orchestrator/sessions/launch-prep-analysis/01-launch-prep-plan.md` containing:

1. **Executive Summary** - Current state assessment and launch readiness score
2. **Completed Work Inventory** - What's done and verified
3. **Critical Issues Detail** - Each of the 7 specific issues investigated
4. **Comprehensive Task List** - All tasks organized by category and priority
5. **Implementation Schedule** - Day-by-day plan through launch
6. **Risk Assessment** - Potential blockers and mitigation strategies
7. **Launch Checklist** - Final verification items

### Constraints & Guidelines

- **DO NOT add new features** - Focus only on polish, fixes, and verification
- **Follow existing patterns** - Use established code style and component patterns
- **Maintain accessibility** - All changes must maintain WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Mobile-first** - Ensure all UI changes work well on mobile
- **Privacy-first** - Don't compromise privacy controls or consent flows
- **Use existing documentation** - Reference `CLAUDE.md`, phase documents, and existing plans

### Success Criteria

The analysis is successful when:
- [ ] All 7 specific issues have been investigated and documented
- [ ] Comprehensive todo list covers all launch preparation needs
- [ ] Tasks are prioritized with clear launch blockers identified
- [ ] Implementation plan is realistic for January 1, 2026 launch
- [ ] Plan is ready for immediate execution by implementation agents
