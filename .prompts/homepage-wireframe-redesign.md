# Prompt: Homepage Wireframe Redesign

> Generated by @prompt-builder on 2025-12-21

## Original Idea
Implement the homepage wireframe design, updating the visual styling to match the wireframe while preserving all existing content and functionality.

## Refined Understanding
Redesign the homepage to match the wireframe's visual style (`docs/homepage-wireframe.jpg`) while preserving all current content and functionality. Key focus areas: organic blob backgrounds in hero, bigger/bolder typography throughout, and matching the wireframe's layout proportions and section styling.

## Target Agent
`@frontend-engineer` - This is focused styling and layout work within existing component architecture. Single-area concern (UI/styling), doesn't require multi-agent coordination.

## Prompt

### Reference
**Wireframe**: `docs/homepage-wireframe.jpg` - Use this as the visual source of truth for all styling decisions.

### Overview
Restyle the CARE Collective homepage (`app/page.tsx` and `components/Hero.tsx`) to match the wireframe design. Preserve all existing content, functionality, and component structure. Focus on visual alignment: backgrounds, typography, spacing, and section styling.

---

### Section 1: Hero Background Redesign

**Current State**: Small animated pulsing circles with blur effects
**Target State**: Large organic blob shapes matching wireframe

**Requirements**:
- Replace current background pattern with organic blob shapes:
  - **Sage blob** (#7A9E99): Large, top-left area, 8-10% opacity
  - **Dusty rose blob** (#D8A8A0): Large, bottom-right area, 6-8% opacity
  - Optional: Small terracotta accent blobs
- Blobs should be **static or very subtle animation** (gentle breathing/floating, NOT pulsing)
- Cream (#FBF2E9) base background
- Blobs should be soft-edged, organic shapes (not perfect circles)
- Consider using CSS or inline SVG for the blob shapes

**Reference**: See wireframe Section 1 (HERO) for exact blob positioning and shape

### Section 2: Typography Refresh

**Goal**: Bigger, bolder text throughout - more visual impact

**Hero Section**:
- Main headline: **96px desktop / 48px mobile**, Ultra Bold/Black weight
- "Southwest Missouri" with gradient (sage → terracotta)
- "CARE Collective" solid brown (#483129)
- Subtitle (CARE acronym): **24px**, Semibold, sage-dark
- Description: **18-20px**, Regular weight

**Section Titles** (What is CARE?, About, What's Happening, etc.):
- **48px desktop / 30px mobile**, Bold weight
- Brown (#483129) color
- Centered alignment

**Card Content**:
- Card titles: **24px**, Bold
- Body text: **18px**, with good line-height (1.6+)
- Step numbers: **48px** circles with bold numbers

**General**:
- Increase font weights where text feels light
- Ensure strong visual hierarchy
- Maintain WCAG contrast requirements

---

### Section 3: Layout & Section Styling

**"What is CARE Collective?" Section**:
- Section title on cream background
- Three cards on **dusty rose at 20% opacity** background
- Organic wave dividers (top and bottom) - cream fill
- Cards: White background, **24px radius**, shadow, hover lift
- Card internal padding: **40px**

**About Section**:
- Section title on cream background  
- Content area: **sage-dark (#5A7D78)** background
- Organic wave divider from cream at top
- Photo: Circular, **280px diameter**, dusty rose border ring
- "Who We Are" heading with handshake icon in white/10% circle
- Body text: **22-24px**, white, relaxed line-height
- CTA: Cream background, brown text

**What's Happening Section**:
- Section title on cream background
- Content on **sage at 15%** background
- Wave dividers top and bottom
- Two-column layout for events/updates

**Community Resources Section**:
- Cream background
- 4 cards in 2x2 grid (or 4 across on large screens)
- Icon backgrounds: sage/10% or dusty-rose/10%
- Hover: lift effect, background color intensify

**Get in Touch Section**:
- **Navy (#324158)** background
- Wave divider from cream at top
- White text for heading/subtitle
- Email card: White background, centered, max-width ~500px

---

### Section 4: Wave Dividers

Use existing `SectionDivider` component with these placements:
- Between cream and dusty-rose sections: `variant="curve"`
- Between cream and sage-dark sections: `variant="organic"` 
- Between cream and sage-light sections: `variant="wave"`
- Ensure proper `fillColor` values match the section being transitioned FROM

---

### Files to Modify

1. **`components/Hero.tsx`** - Background blobs, typography sizing
2. **`app/page.tsx`** - Section backgrounds, typography, spacing, card styling
3. **`app/styles/globals.css`** (if needed) - Any new utility classes or animations

### Files to Reference (Do Not Modify Unless Necessary)

- `components/ui/SectionDivider.tsx` - Already has wave/curve/organic variants
- `tailwind.config.ts` - Brand colors already defined

---

### Constraints

- **Preserve all existing content** - Do not change any text copy
- **Preserve functionality** - Auth, navigation, smooth scroll, etc.
- **Maintain accessibility** - WCAG 2.1 AA, 44px touch targets, proper contrast
- **Mobile-first responsive** - All changes must work on mobile
- **Keep file sizes reasonable** - Components under 200 lines where possible

---

### Success Criteria

1. Hero background matches wireframe blob style (large organic shapes, correct colors/opacity)
2. Typography is noticeably bigger and bolder throughout
3. Section backgrounds match wireframe (dusty-rose/20%, sage-dark, sage/15%, navy)
4. Wave dividers create smooth organic transitions between sections
5. Cards have proper styling (24px radius, shadows, hover effects)
6. All existing functionality still works
7. Passes accessibility checks
8. Responsive on mobile devices

## Context Notes

- Current homepage is ~592 lines in `app/page.tsx` - may need to extract some sections into components if it grows
- Hero component is 116 lines - good size for modifications
- SectionDivider component already supports wave, curve, and organic variants
- Brand colors are defined in Tailwind config (sage, dusty-rose, terracotta, navy, etc.)
- The wireframe was generated with specific brand specifications - refer to those for exact color values
