# Prompt: Homepage Background & Section Architecture

> Generated by @prompt-builder on 2024-12-21

## Original Idea
Redesign the Care Collective homepage background and section divisions, inspired by kinderground.org's visual flow and section transitions.

## Refined Understanding
The current homepage has:
- 6 main sections: Hero, What is CARE, About, What's Happening, Resources, Contact
- Uses curved dividers (`borderRadius: '0 0 50% 50%'`) between sections
- Alternates between cream background and colored sections (dusty-rose/20, sage-dark, sage/15, navy)
- Fixed navy header and footer

Kinderground.org inspiration:
- Clean section transitions with organic curves
- Cohesive color story flowing through sections
- Cards that feel elevated from backgrounds
- Subtle animations on scroll
- Clear visual hierarchy between sections

## Prompt

### Task: Design Homepage Section Architecture & Background Strategy

Design a refined section layout and background system for Care Collective's homepage that creates visual flow, brand cohesion, and clear section delineation.

### Current State Analysis

The homepage currently has 6 sections:

| Section | Current Background | Divider Style |
|---------|-------------------|---------------|
| Hero | Gradient cream to sage-light/20 | None |
| What is CARE | cream header → dusty-rose/20 cards | Curved top/bottom |
| About | cream header → sage-dark body | Curved top only |
| What's Happening | cream header → sage/15 body | Curved top/bottom |
| Resources | cream (flat) | None |
| Contact | navy | Curved top only |

### Design Requirements

1. **Section Count & Purpose**
   - Determine optimal number of sections (current: 6)
   - Define visual weight for each section (primary, secondary, tertiary)
   - Establish content hierarchy flow

2. **Background Strategy Options**
   Evaluate and recommend:
   - **Option A**: Gradient flows (subtle transitions between sections)
   - **Option B**: Color blocking with organic dividers (like kinderground.org)
   - **Option C**: Layered backgrounds with depth (parallax-like effects)
   - **Option D**: Minimal cream with accent section highlights

3. **Section Dividers**
   Design divider system:
   - Curved/wave SVG dividers vs CSS border-radius
   - Consistent or varied heights
   - Color transitions (match above or below?)
   - Performance considerations

4. **Visual Flow Guidelines**
   - How colors should progress top to bottom
   - Where to use brand colors (sage, dusty-rose, terracotta, navy)
   - Balance of "breathing room" (cream) vs colored sections
   - Card elevation strategy on different backgrounds

### Brand Colors Reference

```css
--sage: #7A9E99;           /* Primary actions, trust */
--sage-light: #A3C4BF;     /* Backgrounds, subtle */
--sage-dark: #4A6B66;      /* Headers, emphasis */
--dusty-rose: #D8A8A0;     /* Secondary accent, warmth */
--dusty-rose-light: #E5C6C1;
--dusty-rose-dark: #B88B83;
--terracotta: #BC6547;     /* Brand primary, energy */
--navy: #324158;           /* Text, authority */
--tan: #C39778;            /* Accent, organic */
--cream: #FBF2E9;          /* Background, calm */
--brown: #483129;          /* Text, grounded */
```

### Deliverables

1. **Section Layout Diagram**
   - Visual map of all sections with recommended backgrounds
   - Divider placements and styles
   - Content hierarchy indicators

2. **Background Technique Recommendations**
   For each section, specify:
   - Background type (solid, gradient, pattern, layered)
   - Color values with opacity
   - Divider style (SVG wave, CSS curve, none)
   - Z-index layering notes

3. **Visual Flow Document**
   - Color progression logic (warm → cool → warm, etc.)
   - Rhythm of visual weight (heavy → light → heavy)
   - White space distribution
   - Mobile considerations

4. **Component Requirements**
   - New components needed (e.g., WaveDivider, SectionBackground)
   - Props interface for flexibility
   - Reusability across pages

### Inspiration Reference

Kinderground.org uses:
- Clean SVG wave dividers between sections
- Consistent card elevation with subtle shadows
- Organic color transitions
- Clear CTA placement within sections
- Ample breathing room between content blocks

### Constraints

- Must maintain WCAG 2.1 AA contrast ratios
- Mobile-first (curves must work on small screens)
- Performance: avoid complex SVG animations
- Respect existing section IDs for navigation anchors
- Keep card styles consistent with current design system

### Success Criteria

- [ ] Clear visual distinction between sections
- [ ] Cohesive color story from hero to footer
- [ ] Organic, approachable feel matching brand values
- [ ] No jarring transitions between sections
- [ ] Cards readable on all background types
- [ ] Mobile experience feels natural, not cramped

## Context Notes

**Files to reference:**
- `app/page.tsx` - Current homepage (561 lines)
- `components/Hero.tsx` - Hero section with gradient
- `components/LandingSection.tsx` - Reusable section wrapper
- `app/globals.css` - Current CSS including divider styles

**Existing patterns:**
- Curved dividers use `style={{ borderRadius: '0 0 50% 50%' }}`
- Section padding: `py-16 md:py-24`
- Container: `container mx-auto px-4 max-w-7xl`

**Team preferences:**
- Prefers CSS solutions over complex SVG when possible
- Values simplicity and maintainability
- Mobile-first approach required
