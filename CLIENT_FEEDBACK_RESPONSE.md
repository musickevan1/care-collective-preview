# Client Feedback Response Plan
*Last Updated: January 2025*

## Overview
This document tracks client feedback, our responses, and implementation plans for the CARE Collective platform.

## Latest Client Feedback (January 2025)

### Questions from Client

#### 1. Workflow Question: "When a person responds to a help request, what happens next?"
**Current Implementation:**
- Helper clicks "Offer to Help" ‚Üí Request status changes to "in_progress"
- Helper's name appears on the request card
- Both parties can mark request as completed
- Helper can withdraw offer, owner can cancel/reopen

**Proposed Enhancement:**
- Add contact exchange system (awaiting client preference):
  - Option A: Simple display of contact info after match
  - Option B: In-app message thread
  - Option C: Both options with privacy controls

#### 2. Technical Question: "Is there a limit to the number of category options?"
**Current Implementation:**
- 5 hardcoded categories in `/app/requests/new/page.tsx`
- No technical limit on number of categories

**Proposed Enhancement:**
- Expand to 12 categories initially
- Optional: Admin-managed categories through database

#### 3. Location Question: "How does it know where the person is located?"
**Current Implementation:**
- Location is optional profile field
- User manually enters during signup

**Proposed Enhancement:**
- Add granularity options (city/ZIP/neighborhood)

## Notes for Development Team

1. **Priority Order:**
   - High: Typography and color improvements (immediate UX impact)
   - High: Contact exchange system (core functionality gap)
   - Medium: Category expansion (improves flexibility)
   - Low: Admin features (nice-to-have, not critical)

2. **Risk Mitigation:**
   - All changes use CSS variables for easy adjustment
   - Database migrations prepared but not applied
   - Feature flags control all new functionality
   - Responsive design tested at each step

3. **Client Communication:**
   - Response expected within 24-48 hours
   - 15-minute call offered for quick decisions
   - Implementation can begin immediately on non-blocking items
