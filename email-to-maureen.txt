Subject: Platform Update - Launch Timeline

Hi Maureen,

I hope you had a wonderful Christmas and are enjoying your break! I wanted to share a quick update on platform.

Landing Page
I've revamped the landing page at swmocarecollective.org. When you have a moment, please take a look and let me know if you have any revisions or adjustments needed.

Current Status
I've built the core systems and am now testing and cleaning them up:
- User registration and approval system
- Help request creation and browsing
- Real-time messaging (still adding popup walkthrough)
- Contact exchange with privacy controls
- Admin panel (currently testing CMS features)
- Email notifications (testing in progress)

The foundation is solid, and I'm now refining the user experience.

Launch Timeline
We're targeting launch during January 1-5, 2026. The remaining work involves:
- Finishing testing of notifications and admin features
- Adding messaging walkthrough popups
- Performance optimization
- Security review
- Setting up monitoring

We're on track for the launch window.

Admin Access
You and I will have admin access—no additional team needed for launch.

Meeting
If it would be helpful, I'm happy to schedule a quick meeting to walk through the updates. Just let me know what days and times work best for you.

Thanks,
Evan
