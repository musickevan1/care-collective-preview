## ⚠️ Pending Setup Tasks

### 1. Database Initialization (REQUIRED)
The database tables need to be created in Supabase. 

**To fix this:**
1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project: `fagwisxdmfyyagzihnvh`
3. Navigate to "SQL Editor"
4. Copy the contents of `scripts/init-database.sql`
5. Paste and run the SQL script
6. Verify by running: `node scripts/verify-setup.js`

## 🚀 Ready for Development

Once the database is initialized, you can proceed with development according to the `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md`.

### Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Verify setup is complete
node scripts/verify-setup.js

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Create a feature branch for Phase 1
git checkout -b feature/phase-1-messaging
# OR
git checkout -b feature/phase-1-realtime
```

### Development Phases Overview

#### Phase 1: Core Functionality (Choose One)
- **Option A: Real-time Features** - Add live updates and WebSocket subscriptions
- **Option B: Messaging System** - Enable user-to-user communication

#### Quick Wins (Can implement immediately)
1. **Enable Admin Write Capabilities**
   - Modify `app/admin/` pages to allow data modification
   - Add admin action logging

2. **Add Request Status Tracking**
   - Implement status workflow (open → in_progress → completed)
   - Add status change notifications

3. **Implement Basic Notifications**
   - Toast notifications for actions
   - Badge counters for unread items

### Feature Flag Usage

Features are controlled via environment variables. To enable a feature:

1. Set the flag in `.env.local`:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_MESSAGING=true
   ```

2. Use in your code:
   ```typescript
   import { features } from '@/lib/features';
   
   if (features.messaging) {
     // Show messaging UI
   }
   ```

### Current Feature Status
- ❌ Real-time Features (Phase 1A)
- ❌ Messaging System (Phase 1B)
- ❌ Advanced Profiles (Phase 2)
- ❌ Smart Matching (Phase 2)
- ❌ Community Groups (Phase 3)
- ❌ Events System (Phase 3)
- ❌ PWA Support (Phase 5)

## 📊 Database Schema Summary

The application uses three main tables:

1. **profiles** - User profile information
   - Links to Supabase Auth users
   - Stores name, location, created_at

2. **help_requests** - Community help requests
   - Categories: groceries, transport, household, medical, other
   - Urgency levels: normal, urgent, critical
   - Status: open, closed

3. **messages** - User messaging (prepared for Phase 1B)
   - Thread-based conversations
   - Read receipts
   - Links to help requests

## 🔒 Security Configuration

Row Level Security (RLS) is configured for all tables:
- Users can view all profiles and requests
- Users can only modify their own data
- Messages are private between sender and recipient

## 📝 Next Actions for Driver Agents

1. **Initialize Database** (if not done)
   - Run `scripts/init-database.sql` in Supabase

2. **Choose Implementation Path**
   - Review Phase 1 options in `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md`
   - Create feature branch
   - Begin implementation

3. **Test Current Functionality**
   - Run `npm run dev`
   - Test authentication flow
   - Verify dashboard and request creation

4. **Monitor Progress**
   - Use `node scripts/verify-setup.js` to check status
   - Update feature flags as features are completed
   - Commit changes regularly

## 🎯 Success Metrics

Track these as you implement features:
- [ ] Database tables created and accessible
- [ ] Authentication working (signup/login)
- [ ] Dashboard loading user data
- [ ] Help requests can be created and viewed
- [ ] Admin panel accessible (read-only)
- [ ] Feature flags controlling new features
