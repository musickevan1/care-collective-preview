# /compact - Care Collective Session Summary

Your task is to create a detailed summary of the conversation so far, paying close attention to the user's explicit requests and your previous actions in the context of the Care Collective mutual aid platform.

This summary should be thorough in capturing technical details, code patterns, architectural decisions, and domain-specific considerations (privacy, accessibility, community safety) that are essential for continuing development work without losing context.

Before providing your final summary, wrap your analysis in <analysis> tags to organize your thoughts and ensure you've covered all necessary points. In your analysis process:

1. Chronologically analyze each message and section of the conversation. For each section thoroughly identify:
   - The user's explicit requests and intents
   - Your approach to addressing the user's requests
   - Key decisions, technical concepts and code patterns
   - Specific details like file names, full code snippets, function signatures, file edits, etc
   - Privacy/security implications and accessibility considerations
2. Double-check for technical accuracy and completeness, addressing each required element thoroughly.
3. Verify alignment with Care Collective core values: accessibility, privacy, community safety, KISS+YAGNI.

Your summary should include the following sections:

## 1. Primary Request and Intent
Capture all of the user's explicit requests and intents in detail, including:
- Core feature/functionality being developed or fixed
- Domain context (help requests, messaging, contact exchange, admin, etc.)
- Any explicit privacy, security, or accessibility requirements mentioned

## 2. Key Technical Concepts
List all important technical concepts, technologies, and frameworks discussed:

- Authentication and authorization patterns
- Real-time features (WebSocket channels, optimistic updates)
- Encryption or moderation services
- Testing approaches

## 3. Domain-Specific Patterns
Document Care Collective-specific patterns and considerations:
- **Help Request Patterns**: Category, urgency, status handling
- **Contact Exchange**: Privacy consent mechanisms, contact sharing flows
- **Messaging System**: Real-time updates, moderation, encryption
- **Privacy/Security**: PII protection, consent tracking, audit trails
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliance, screen reader support, keyboard navigation
- **Mobile-First**: Touch target sizes, responsive patterns, offline support

## 6. Problem Solving
Document problems solved and any ongoing troubleshooting efforts:
- Issue description and symptoms
- Root cause analysis
- Solution approach and implementation
- Verification steps taken
- Any remaining edge cases or follow-up needed

## 7. Safety and Compliance Checks
Verify adherence to critical guidelines:
- [ ] Privacy: No contact info exposed without consent
- [ ] Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance maintained
- [ ] Security: Input validation, sanitization applied
- [ ] Mobile: 44px touch targets, responsive design
- [ ] TypeScript: No JSX.Element namespace usage (use ReactElement)
- [ ] Testing: 80% coverage for critical paths

## 8. Deployment Status
If deployment was involved:
- [ ] Git commit created with descriptive message
- [ ] Pushed to main branch
- [ ] `npx vercel --prod` executed (CRITICAL for main domain update)
- [ ] Service worker cache version updated (automatic via prebuild)
- [ ] Production verification completed

## 9. Context Engineering Status
If relevant to the current phase:
- Current phase from master plan (e.g., "Phase 2.3 - Admin Panel")
- PRP method stage (Planning/Research/Production)
- Updates needed to `PROJECT_STATUS.md` or phase plans

## 10. Pending Tasks
Outline any pending tasks explicitly requested:
- [ ] Task 1 with domain context
- [ ] Task 2 with acceptance criteria
- [ ] Task 3 with dependencies noted

## 11. Current Work
Describe in detail precisely what was being worked on immediately before this summary request:
- Specific file(s) and function(s) being modified
- Code snippets showing exact state of work
- Test cases being written or fixed
- Any debugging in progress
- Terminal commands run and their output

## 12. Optional Next Step
List the next step that you will take that is related to the most recent work:
- IMPORTANT: Ensure this step is DIRECTLY in line with the user's explicit requests
- If the last task was concluded, only list next steps explicitly requested by the user
- Do not start on tangential tasks without confirming first
- Include acceptance criteria for completion

Include direct quotes from the most recent conversation showing exactly what task you were working on and where you left off. Use verbatim quotes to ensure there's no drift in task interpretation.

**Example Output:**

<analysis>
User requested implementation of contact exchange privacy consent flow. I analyzed existing patterns in lib/messaging/privacy.ts, implemented explicit consent checkboxes in components/contact-exchange-form.tsx, and added validation using contactExchangeSchema from CLAUDE.md. Need to verify WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for the checkbox and ensure audit trail is captured in contact_exchanges table. Current work was adding tests for the consent flow.
</analysis>

<summary>
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   Implement explicit consent mechanism for contact exchange feature to ensure users explicitly agree before sharing contact information (phone/email) with help requesters.

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - Zod schema validation with z.literal(true) for required consent
   - Server Actions for contact exchange submission
   - Supabase RLS policies for contact_exchanges table
   - WCAG 2.1 AA checkbox labeling and focus states

3. Domain-Specific Patterns:
   - **Contact Exchange**: Explicit consent required before any contact sharing
   - **Privacy**: Audit trail with consent_given boolean and timestamp
   - **Accessibility**: Checkbox with clear label, 44px touch target, focus ring

4. Files and Code Sections:
   - `components/contact-exchange-form.tsx` (app/requests/[id]/contact-exchange-form.tsx:45)
     - Added consent checkbox with WCAG-compliant labeling
     - Implemented validation preventing submission without consent
     ```typescript
     const [consent, setConsent] = useState(false);

     const handleSubmit = async () => {
       const validated = contactExchangeSchema.parse({
         requestId, contactMethod, message, consent
       });
       // consent must be true or validation throws
     }
     ```

   - `lib/messaging/contact-exchange.ts` (lib/messaging/contact-exchange.ts:23)
     - Server-side consent validation
     - Audit trail insertion with consent_given column

5. Database and Schema Changes:
   - contact_exchanges table: verified consent_given column exists
   - RLS policy ensures only requester and helper can view exchange records

6. Problem Solving:
   - Issue: Users could potentially share contact info without understanding implications
   - Solution: Added explicit consent checkbox with clear privacy language
   - Verification: Tested form submission with consent=false (correctly blocked)

7. Safety and Compliance Checks:
   - [x] Privacy: Explicit consent required, audit trail captured
   - [x] Accessibility: Checkbox has proper label, 44px touch target, focus visible
   - [x] Security: Server-side validation of consent in addition to client-side
   - [x] Mobile: Touch target meets 44px minimum
   - [x] TypeScript: Using ReactElement instead of JSX.Element
   - [ ] Testing: Need to complete test coverage for consent flow

8. Deployment Status:
   - Not yet deployed, pending test completion

9. Context Engineering Status:
   - Phase 2.1 (Messaging System) - Privacy features
   - Production stage of PRP method

10. Pending Tasks:
    - [ ] Complete test coverage for contact exchange consent flow
    - [ ] Verify screen reader announces consent requirement clearly
    - [ ] Add error message styling for failed consent validation

11. Current Work:
    Writing tests for contact exchange consent in `tests/contact-exchange.test.tsx`:
    ```typescript
    it('blocks submission without consent', async () => {
      const { getByRole } = render(<ContactExchangeForm requestId="123" />);
      const submitButton = getByRole('button', { name: /share contact/i });
      await userEvent.click(submitButton);
      expect(screen.getByText(/consent required/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
    });
    ```

12. Optional Next Step:
    Complete the remaining two test cases for the consent flow:
    - Test successful submission with consent=true
    - Test accessibility: verify checkbox is keyboard accessible and screen reader compatible

    User quote: "Make sure the consent checkbox works properly and add tests"
