## Quick Start

### Starting a New Feature

```bash
# 1. Start from develop
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# 2. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# 3. Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: your feature description ü§ñ Generated with Claude Code"

# 4. Push and create PR
git push -u origin feature/your-feature-name
gh pr create --base develop
```

### Reviewing a PR

```bash
# 1. Check out PR branch
gh pr checkout <pr-number>

# 2. Run automated checks
npm run type-check  # Must pass (0 errors)
npm run lint        # Must pass (0 warnings)
npm run test        # Must pass (80%+ coverage)
npm run build       # Must succeed

# 3. Review against checklist
# See ../pr-review-checklist.md

# 4. Approve or request changes
gh pr review --approve
# or
gh pr review --request-changes --body "Changes needed: ..."
```

### Using Multi-Agent Delegation

```typescript
// For complex tasks, use parallel agents:

// ‚úÖ Efficient (parallel in single message)
[
  Task(Feature Agent): "Implement new feature",
  Task(Testing Agent): "Write comprehensive tests",
  Task(Security Agent): "Audit security implications",
  Task(Docs Agent): "Update documentation"
]

// ‚ùå Inefficient (sequential)
Task(Feature Agent): "Implement"
// wait...
Task(Testing Agent): "Test"
// wait...
Task(Docs Agent): "Document"
```
