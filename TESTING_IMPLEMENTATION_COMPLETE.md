## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Authentication State Synchronization Solution

The primary issue identified in TESTING_PLAN.md has been completely resolved:

**Problem**: `/requests/new` used client-side auth while other pages used server-side auth, causing "You must be logged in" errors for authenticated users.

**Solution**: 
1. Created `lib/auth/session-sync.ts` with utilities:
   - `ensureAuthSync()` - Ensures consistent auth state
   - `requireAuthentication()` - Validates user with valid session
   - `refreshSession()` - Handles token refresh
   - `handleAuthError()` - Consistent error handling

2. Updated `/requests/new` page to use session synchronization
3. Enhanced middleware for better session management
