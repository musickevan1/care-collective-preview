# Option B: Disable turbopack
npx next dev --turbo=false

# Option C: With more memory
NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=4096" npm run dev
```

3. ✅ Click "Select All" to select all visible users
4. ✅ Choose a bulk operation (e.g., "Activate Users")
5. ✅ Add a reason if required
6. ✅ Execute and watch progress tracking
7. ✅ Check browser console for email notification logs

### **Test 2: Email Notifications**
1. Go to `/admin/users`
2. Click "View Details" on a user
3. Use "Actions" dropdown → "Activate User"
4. ✅ Check browser console for email notification output:
```

Subject: ✅ Your Care Collective account has been activated
=====================================
```

3. ✅ Try exporting data (Users, Help Requests, Messages)

### **Test 4: Resolved TODO Items**
Check that these files no longer contain "TODO:" comments:
- `app/api/admin/users/route.ts` (line 176 previously)
- `app/api/admin/applications/route.ts` (line 110 previously)
- `app/api/messaging/messages/[id]/report/route.ts` (line 228 previously)

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### **If Dev Server Won't Start**
```bash
# Diagnostic command
npm run dev 2>&1 | head -20

# Check for port conflicts
lsof -i :3000

# Kill any existing Next.js processes
pkill -f "next dev"

# Nuclear reset
rm -rf node_modules .next
npm install
npm run dev
```

### **If Database Migration Fails**
```bash
# Reset and reapply migrations
supabase db reset
supabase migration up

# Check status
supabase status
```

### **If You Don't See New Features**
1. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R / Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Verify you're logged in as an admin user
3. Check browser console for any JavaScript errors
4. Verify the migration was applied: `supabase migration list`

### **Memory Issues**
```bash
# If system is low on memory
NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=2048" npm run dev
```

### **TypeScript Errors (Non-blocking)**
The core Phase 2.3 functionality will work even if there are TypeScript errors from other parts of the codebase. Focus on the admin panel functionality.
