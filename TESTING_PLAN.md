# Care Collective Website Testing & Issue Documentation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines a comprehensive testing strategy for the Care Collective mutual aid platform to identify, document, and prioritize issues for fixing.

## Primary Issue Identified
**Authentication State Mismatch**: The main issue occurs because there's a client-server authentication state synchronization problem. The `/requests/new` page uses client-side authentication (`createClient()` from `lib/supabase/client.ts`) while other pages use server-side authentication (`createClient()` from `lib/supabase/server.ts`), causing inconsistent user state detection.

**Specific Problem**: When logged in users try to create a help request, they see "You must be logged in to create a request" error even though they are already authenticated.

## Comprehensive Testing Strategy

### Phase 1: Authentication & Navigation Flow Testing
1. **Test user registration/login flow**
   - Sign up with new account
   - Login with existing credentials
   - Password reset functionality
   - Email verification (if enabled)

2. **Test authentication persistence** 
   - Check if login state persists across page refreshes
   - Test session timeout behavior
   - Test browser tab/window switching

3. **Test protected route access**
   - Verify unauthorized users are redirected to `/login`
   - Test access to `/dashboard`, `/requests`, `/admin` when not logged in
   - Verify proper redirects after login

4. **Test the specific "create request while logged in" issue**
   - Login successfully
   - Navigate to `/requests/new`
   - Attempt to create a help request
   - Document if authentication error occurs

5. **Test logout functionality**
   - Test logout button/form functionality
   - Verify session cleanup and redirect to home/login
   - Confirm cannot access protected routes after logout
