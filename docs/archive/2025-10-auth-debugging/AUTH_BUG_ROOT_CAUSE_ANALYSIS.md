# Authentication Bug - Root Cause Analysis
**Date:** October 8, 2025
**Session:** Deep Debugging with Enhanced Logging
**Priority:** üö® CRITICAL - Beta Launch Blocker

---

## üéØ Executive Summary

**BUG CONFIRMED:** Rejected user bypasses all security layers and sees wrong user's name on dashboard.

**Critical Finding:** Dashboard shows "Test Approved User!" when logged in as "test.rejected.final@carecollective.test"

**Status:** Root cause investigation in progress - enhanced logging added but NOT YET DEPLOYED

---

## üìä Test Results

### Test Scenario: Rejected User Login
- **Credentials Used:** test.rejected.final@carecollective.test / TestPass123!
- **Expected Result:** Login blocked or redirected to /access-denied
- **Actual Result:** ‚ùå Successfully accessed /dashboard
- **Dashboard Display:** "Welcome back, Test Approved User!" (WRONG NAME)

### Database Verification
```sql
-- Rejected User (correct data in database)
SELECT id, name, verification_status FROM profiles
WHERE id = '93b0b7b4-7cd3-4ffc-8f02-3777f29da4fb';

Result: {
  id: "93b0b7b4-7cd3-4ffc-8f02-3777f29da4fb",
  name: "Test Rejected User",
  verification_status: "rejected"
}

-- Approved User (whose name appears on rejected user's dashboard)
SELECT id, name, verification_status FROM profiles
WHERE id = '54f99d62-6e6b-47d0-a22b-7aa449a3a76a';

Result: {
  id: "54f99d62-6e6b-47d0-a22b-7aa449a3a76a",
  name: "Test Approved User",
  verification_status: "approved"
}
```

**CRITICAL:** Database has correct data. The bug is in the application layer, not the database.

---

## üîç Investigation Findings

### 1. RLS Policies (Verified as Correct)
```sql
profiles_select_own_only: (auth.uid() = id)
profiles_insert_own_only: (auth.uid() = id) AND (COALESCE(auth_mismatch, false) = false)
profiles_update_own_or_admin: (auth.uid() = id)
```
**Status:** ‚úÖ RLS policies are correctly configured

### 2. Service Role Implementation (Verified as Present)
- ‚úÖ `lib/supabase/admin.ts` - Service role client created
- ‚úÖ `lib/supabase/middleware-edge.ts` - Uses service role for profile queries
- ‚úÖ `app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Uses service role for profile queries
- ‚úÖ `app/auth/callback/route.ts` - Has rejected user blocking logic

**Status:** ‚úÖ Service role pattern implemented in code

### 3. Auth Callback Logic (Verified as Correct)
```typescript
// app/auth/callback/route.ts (lines 48-53)
if (profile.verification_status === 'rejected') {
  console.log('[Auth Callback] BLOCKING REJECTED USER - signing out')
  await supabase.auth.signOut()
  next = '/access-denied?reason=rejected'
}
```
**Status:** ‚úÖ Rejection logic exists and should execute

### 4. Cookie/Session Analysis
- Cookies are httpOnly (cannot access from JavaScript)
- Session works for Server Components (dashboard renders)
- Session FAILS for API Routes (diagnostic endpoint returns 401)

**CRITICAL CLUE:** Session propagation issue between different Next.js contexts

---

## üö® Primary Hypotheses

### Hypothesis A: Auth Session Has Wrong User ID (HIGH PROBABILITY)
**Evidence:**
- Dashboard shows "Test Approved User!" instead of "Test Rejected User!"
- Database has correct data for both users
- This suggests auth.getUser() returns approved user's ID when rejected user logs in

**Test:** Add logging to capture actual user ID from auth.getUser() at every stage

**Implications:** This would be a Supabase auth bug OR a session corruption issue

### Hypothesis B: Service Role Query Returns Wrong Data (MEDIUM PROBABILITY)
**Evidence:**
- Service role should bypass RLS and return exact row by ID
- Database has correct data
- If query is `WHERE id = rejectedUserId` but returns approved user's data, this is a database-level bug

**Test:** Add logging to capture SQL query parameters and results

**Implications:** Critical database corruption or query bug

### Hypothesis C: Middleware Not Executing (LOW PROBABILITY)
**Evidence:**
- Auth callback has rejection logic
- Dashboard loads successfully (suggesting no middleware block)

**Test:** Add entry-point logging to middleware to verify execution

**Implications:** Middleware configuration issue or Edge Runtime compatibility problem

### Hypothesis D: Browser Session Cache (LOW PROBABILITY)
**Evidence:**
- Previous testing may have created approved user session
- Playwright may reuse cached cookies

**Test:** Clear all cookies and retry with fresh browser instance

**Implications:** Testing artifact, not a real bug

## üìù Enhanced Logging Added (NOT YET DEPLOYED)

### Files Modified:
1. **lib/supabase/admin.ts** - Service role data flow tracking
   - Input user ID logging
   - Environment variable verification
   - Output profile data logging
   - Mismatch detection

2. **lib/supabase/middleware-edge.ts** - Middleware execution tracing
   - Before/after service role query logging
   - User ID tracking at each stage
   - Decision point logging (block vs allow)

3. **app/dashboard/page.tsx** - Auth session inspection
   - Auth check start logging
   - Before/after profile fetch logging
   - Profile ID vs auth user ID comparison

### Commit Status:
- ‚úÖ Committed locally: `5e8eade` (Oct 8, 2025)
- ‚ùå NOT PUSHED: Git authentication failed
- ‚ùå NOT DEPLOYED: Production still running Oct 6th deployment (`9bd2405`)

**CRITICAL:** Enhanced logging MUST be deployed to production to capture actual data flow

---

## üéØ Next Steps (IMMEDIATE)

### Step 1: Deploy Enhanced Logging to Production
```bash
# Push commit (requires manual authentication)
git push origin main

# Verify deployment
npx vercel inspect https://care-collective-preview.vercel.app
```

### Step 2: Test Rejected User Login with Logging
1. Clear all browser cookies/cache
2. Navigate to login page in incognito mode
3. Login as: test.rejected.final@carecollective.test / TestPass123!
4. Check Vercel deployment logs for our enhanced logging output

### Step 3: Analyze Logs to Determine Root Cause
Look for:
- `[Service Role] INPUT userId:` - What user ID was passed?
- `[Service Role] RESULT:` - What profile data was returned?
- `[Middleware] BEFORE service role query:` - What user ID does middleware see?
- `[Dashboard] AFTER profile fetch:` - What profile data does dashboard receive?

### Step 4: Implement Targeted Fix
Based on log analysis, implement one of:
- **If auth session wrong:** Force logout and re-authentication
- **If service role wrong:** Fix query or database corruption
- **If middleware not executing:** Fix middleware configuration
- **If cache issue:** Implement cache-busting headers

## üî¨ Diagnostic Commands

### Check Current Deployment
```bash
npx vercel inspect https://care-collective-preview.vercel.app
```

### View Real-time Logs (After Deployment)
```bash
npx vercel logs [deployment-url]
```

### Test Diagnostic Endpoint (With Active Session)
```bash
# Login as rejected user first, then:
curl https://care-collective-preview.vercel.app/api/test-auth \
  -H "Cookie: [copy from browser dev tools]"
```

### Verify Database State
```sql
-- Check rejected user data
SELECT id, name, verification_status FROM profiles
WHERE id = '93b0b7b4-7cd3-4ffc-8f02-3777f29da4fb';

-- Check for any auth_mismatch flags
SELECT id, name, auth_mismatch FROM profiles
WHERE auth_mismatch = true;
```

## üö¶ Go/No-Go Status

**BETA LAUNCH:** üî¥ ABSOLUTE NO-GO

**Blocker:** Critical authentication bypass - rejected users have full platform access

**Security Impact:** EXTREME - Data leakage, unauthorized access, trust violation

**Timeline:** Unknown until root cause identified with enhanced logging

**Last Updated:** October 8, 2025 - 8:30 PM CDT
**Created By:** Claude Code (Deep Debugging Session)
**Next Action:** Push enhanced logging commit + test in production
**Estimated Resolution:** 2-4 hours after logging deployed
