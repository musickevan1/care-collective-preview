  if (error || !user) return null;

  // Get user profile with verification status
  const { data: profile } = await supabase
    .from('profiles')
    .select('id, name, location, verification_status, is_admin')
    .eq('id', user.id)
    .single();

  // Check if user is approved or admin
  if (!profile || (profile.verification_status !== 'approved' && !profile.is_admin)) {
    return null; // This will trigger redirect to login/waiting page
  }

  return { /* user data */ };
}
```

## üîß What Needs Attention Before Beta Launch

### HIGH PRIORITY - Must Fix for Beta

#### 1. **Email Notification System** üî¥ CRITICAL
**Impact**: User experience severely degraded without email notifications

**Missing Notifications**:
1. **User Application Decisions**
   - **File**: `app/api/admin/users/route.ts:176`
   - **Status**: TODO comment exists, implementation pending
   - **User Impact**: Users don't know when they're approved/rejected
   - **Priority**: CRITICAL - Blocks beta launch

2. **Admin Moderation Alerts**
   - **File**: `app/api/messaging/messages/[id]/report/route.ts:228`
   - **Status**: TODO comment exists, implementation pending
   - **Admin Impact**: Admins miss urgent moderation items
   - **Priority**: HIGH - Needed for effective community management

3. **Application Decision Notifications**
   - **File**: `app/api/admin/applications/route.ts:110`
   - **Status**: TODO comment exists, implementation pending
   - **User Impact**: No confirmation of application submission or decision
   - **Priority**: CRITICAL - Core user flow broken

**Implementation Requirements**:
- **Email Service**: Resend library already configured (`lib/email-service.ts`)
- **Dependencies**: `resend@6.0.2` already in package.json
- **Environment Variable**: `RESEND_API_KEY` needs to be set
- **Templates Needed**:
  - Welcome email for approved users
  - Application received confirmation
  - Application decision (approved/rejected)
  - Admin alert for reported content
  - Help request status updates (optional but desirable)

**Estimated Effort**: 4-6 hours to implement all critical email notifications

**Recommendation**:
```typescript
// Priority order for implementation:
1. User approval/rejection emails (CRITICAL)
2. Application received confirmation (HIGH)
3. Admin moderation alerts (HIGH)
4. Help request notifications (MEDIUM - can be post-launch)
```

---

#### 2. **Database Indexes Application** üü° HIGH PRIORITY
**Impact**: Query performance degradation under load

**Status**: Indexes prepared in Phase 3.1 but not yet applied to production

**Prepared Indexes** (Ready for Manual Application):
```sql
-- Help requests performance
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_help_requests_status_created
  ON help_requests(status, created_at DESC);

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_help_requests_category_urgency
  ON help_requests(category, urgency);

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_help_requests_user_status
  ON help_requests(user_id, status);

-- Messaging performance
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_messages_conversation_created
  ON messages(conversation_id, created_at DESC);

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_messages_recipient_read
  ON messages(recipient_id, read_at);

-- Full-text search optimization
CREATE INDEX idx_help_requests_search ON help_requests
  USING GIN(to_tsvector('english', title || ' ' || coalesce(description, '')));
```

**Application Method**:
1. Connect to Supabase production database
2. Run migrations manually via Supabase CLI or SQL editor
3. Use `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` to avoid table locks
4. Monitor index creation progress
5. Validate query performance improvement

**Estimated Effort**: 30 minutes to apply + 15 minutes validation

**Recommendation**: Apply indexes immediately before beta launch to ensure optimal query performance under increased load.

---

#### 3. **Redis Rate Limiting Implementation** üü° HIGH PRIORITY
**Impact**: In-memory rate limiting won't scale across multiple Vercel instances

**Current Implementation**: In-memory Map-based rate limiting
**File**: `lib/security/rate-limiter.ts:4`
```typescript
// ‚ö†Ô∏è Current: In-memory store (doesn't scale)
const requestCounts = new Map<string, { count: number; resetTime: number }>()
```

**Problem**:
- Rate limit state is not shared across Vercel Edge Functions
- User can bypass rate limits by hitting different instances
- Memory leaks possible under high load

**Solution Options**:
1. **Vercel KV (Redis)** - Recommended for Vercel deployment
   ```bash
   npm install @vercel/kv
   ```
   - Automatic scaling with Vercel infrastructure
   - Minimal code changes required
   - Built-in persistence and replication

2. **Upstash Redis** - Alternative for more control
   - REST-based Redis API
   - Global edge network
   - Pay-per-request pricing

**Migration Example**:
```typescript
import { kv } from '@vercel/kv';

async check(request: NextRequest, identifier?: string): Promise<RateLimitResult> {
  const key = this.getIdentifier(request, identifier);
  const now = Date.now();

  // Get current count from Redis
  const current = await kv.get<{count: number; resetTime: number}>(key);

  if (!current || current.resetTime <= now) {
    // Set new window
    await kv.set(key, { count: 1, resetTime: now + this.config.windowMs }, {
      px: this.config.windowMs // Auto-expire
    });
    return { success: true, /* ... */ };
  }

  // Increment and check limit
  if (current.count >= this.config.max) {
    return { success: false, /* ... */ };
  }

  current.count++;
  await kv.set(key, current, { px: current.resetTime - now });
  return { success: true, /* ... */ };
}
```

**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 hours for implementation + testing

**Recommendation**: Implement Vercel KV before beta launch to prevent rate limit bypass exploits. This is a security risk that needs addressing.

#### 4. **TypeScript and ESLint Build Errors** üü° MEDIUM PRIORITY
**Impact**: Technical debt that could hide real issues

**Current Configuration** (`next.config.js:143-152`):
```javascript
typescript: {
  // ‚ö†Ô∏è Temporarily bypass during build while maintaining local type checking
  ignoreBuildErrors: true,
},

eslint: {
  // ‚ö†Ô∏è Temporarily disable ESLint during build until config is fixed
  ignoreDuringBuilds: true,
},
```

**Problem**:
- Build errors are being suppressed
- No visibility into actual TypeScript/ESLint issues
- Could mask real bugs or security issues

**Investigation Needed**:
1. Run `npm run type-check` to identify TypeScript errors
2. Run `npm run lint` to identify ESLint warnings/errors
3. Review and fix or document exceptions
4. Remove build bypasses once issues resolved

**Known TypeScript Issues**:
- Potential `JSX.Element` vs `ReactElement` inconsistencies (documented in CLAUDE.md)
- Some components may be using legacy type definitions

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 hours to identify and fix/document all issues

**Recommendation**: Address before beta launch to prevent hidden bugs from surfacing in production. At minimum, run type-check and lint locally and document known acceptable violations.

---

### MEDIUM PRIORITY - Should Address for Beta

#### 5. **ESLint Flat Config Migration** üü° MEDIUM
**Impact**: Using legacy ESLint configuration format

**Current File**: `eslint.config.js` exists but may not be fully compatible with Next.js 14
**Legacy Format**: Likely still using `.eslintrc` patterns

**Migration Needed**:
```javascript
// Current: .eslintrc.json format
// Required: Flat config format (eslint.config.js)
import nextConfig from 'eslint-config-next';

export default [
  ...nextConfig,
  {
    rules: {
      // Care Collective specific rules
      'react/jsx-no-target-blank': 'error',
      '@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any': 'warn',
      // ... other rules
    }
  }
];
```

**Benefits**:
- Better performance with flat config
- Clearer configuration hierarchy
- Better IDE integration

**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 hours

**Recommendation**: Can be deferred to post-beta if time constrained, but should be addressed before full launch.

---

#### 6. **Conversation Search Functionality** üü° MEDIUM
**Impact**: User experience degraded with many conversations

**Current Status**: Feature planned but not implemented
**Evidence**: Test TODO in `__tests__/messaging/ConversationList.test.tsx`

**User Story**:
- As a user with many active conversations
- I want to search my message history
- So that I can quickly find specific conversations or messages

**Implementation Requirements**:
- Search input component in conversation list
- Full-text search query on messages table
- Highlight search terms in results
- Filter conversation list by search results

**Database Support**:
```sql
-- Already prepared in migrations
CREATE INDEX idx_messages_search ON messages
  USING GIN(to_tsvector('english', content));
```

**Estimated Effort**: 4-6 hours

**Recommendation**: Nice-to-have for beta but not critical. Can be added based on beta user feedback.

---

#### 7. **Image Upload for Help Requests** üü° MEDIUM
**Impact**: Limited expressiveness for certain help request types

**Current Status**: No image upload capability
**Use Cases**:
- Household items that need repair
- Items for exchange or donation
- Visual clarification of needs

**Implementation Requirements**:
- Supabase Storage bucket configuration
- File upload component with validation
- Image optimization and compression
- RLS policies for image access control
- CDN integration for fast delivery

**Security Considerations**:
- File type validation (images only)
- File size limits (max 5MB recommended)
- Virus/malware scanning
- User quota management

**Estimated Effort**: 6-8 hours

**Recommendation**: Defer to post-beta launch iteration based on user demand. Current text-based system is functional for MVP.

---

### LOW PRIORITY - Post-Beta Enhancements

#### 8. **Message Editing Feature** üü¢ LOW
**Current Behavior**: Messages cannot be edited after sending
**Rationale**: Intentional design for audit trail and trust & safety
**User Impact**: Minor inconvenience, users can send corrections

**Recommendation**: Monitor beta feedback. If users frequently request this, consider implementing with edit history tracking.

---

#### 9. **Message Reactions/Emoji System** üü¢ LOW
**Current Status**: Backend implemented, UI may need polish
**User Impact**: Nice-to-have social feature

**Recommendation**: Validate UI/UX during beta testing and enhance based on feedback.

---

#### 10. **Bulk Admin Operations UI** üü¢ LOW
**Current Status**: Backend exists, UI could be more intuitive
**Admin Impact**: Minor efficiency improvement

**Recommendation**: Gather admin feedback during beta and enhance in post-launch iteration.
