# Planning Phase: Strategic Analysis & Task Breakdown

## Overview

The Planning Phase is the foundation of the PRP method, focusing on strategic analysis and comprehensive task breakdown. This phase typically consumes 15-35% of available context but saves significant time and resources in subsequent phases.

## Core Objectives

### 1. Requirements Clarification
- **Understand the "why"** behind the requested work
- **Define success criteria** clearly and measurably
- **Identify stakeholders** and their specific needs
- **Map user journey** impact and touchpoints

### 2. Architectural Assessment
- **Analyze existing patterns** that can be leveraged
- **Identify integration points** with current system
- **Map dependencies** and potential conflicts
- **Assess technical constraints** and limitations

### 3. Strategic Decomposition
- **Break complex work** into manageable, atomic tasks
- **Sequence tasks** based on dependencies and priorities
- **Estimate effort** for each component
- **Identify parallel work** opportunities

## Planning Templates

### Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: [Major concerns that could block progress]
- **Medium Risk**: [Issues that might slow progress]
- **Low Risk**: [Minor concerns to monitor]

### Dependencies
- **Blocked by**: [What must be completed first?]
- **Blocking**: [What is waiting on this work?]
- **External**: [Any external dependencies?]
```

### Bug Fix Planning

```markdown
## Bug Fix: [Bug Description]

### Issue Analysis
- **Symptoms**: [What is the observable problem?]
- **Impact**: [Who is affected and how severely?]
- **Root Cause**: [What is actually causing the issue?]
- **Scope**: [How widespread is the problem?]

### Fix Strategy
- **Approach**: [How will we solve this?]
- **Minimal Change**: [Smallest possible fix?]
- **Testing Strategy**: [How will we validate the fix?]
- **Rollback Plan**: [What if we need to revert?]

### Implementation Tasks
1. **Investigation** (Est: X hours)
   - [ ] Reproduce issue consistently
   - [ ] Analyze code and data flow
   - [ ] Identify root cause

2. **Fix Implementation** (Est: X hours)
   - [ ] Implement targeted solution
   - [ ] Add regression test
   - [ ] Validate fix locally

3. **Validation** (Est: X hours)
   - [ ] Test edge cases
   - [ ] Verify no new regressions
   - [ ] Update documentation if needed
```

### Refactoring Planning

```markdown
## Refactoring: [Area/Component Name]

### Current State Analysis
- **Problems**: [What issues exist with current implementation?]
- **Technical Debt**: [What debt are we addressing?]
- **Performance Issues**: [Any performance problems?]
- **Maintainability Concerns**: [What makes this hard to maintain?]

### Target State Vision
- **Desired Architecture**: [What should this look like?]
- **Quality Improvements**: [What quality metrics will improve?]
- **Maintainability Gains**: [How will this be easier to maintain?]
- **Performance Goals**: [What performance improvements expected?]

### Migration Strategy
- **Incremental Approach**: [How will we refactor safely?]
- **Backward Compatibility**: [What compatibility must be maintained?]
- **Testing Strategy**: [How will we ensure no regression?]
- **Rollout Plan**: [How will we deploy changes?]
```

## Context Management

### Planning Phase Context Usage
- **Feature Implementation**: 15-25% of available context
- **Bug Fixes**: 10-15% of available context
- **Refactoring**: 25-35% of available context
- **New Architecture**: 30-40% of available context

### Efficiency Tips
1. **Use templates** - Don't recreate planning structures from scratch
2. **Batch similar analysis** - Group related decisions together
3. **Document assumptions** - Record thinking for future reference
4. **Set clear boundaries** - Don't over-plan; leave room for adaptation
