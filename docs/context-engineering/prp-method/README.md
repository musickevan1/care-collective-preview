# PRP Method: Planning, Research, Production

## Overview

The PRP (Planning, Research, Production) method is an advanced context engineering strategy designed to maximize development efficiency while working with AI assistance. This methodology is specifically tailored for the Care Collective platform's mutual aid mission and technical requirements.

## Core Philosophy

### Context as a Precious Resource
- **Limited context window**: Every token counts toward meaningful progress
- **Strategic planning**: Front-load analysis to minimize context waste
- **Knowledge preservation**: Document insights to prevent repetitive research

### Quality Through Structure
- **Systematic approach**: Each phase builds upon the previous
- **Clear deliverables**: Defined outputs prevent scope creep
- **Measurable progress**: Tangible milestones track advancement

## The Three Phases

### üéØ Planning Phase
**Goal**: Strategic analysis and comprehensive task breakdown

**Key Activities**:
- **Requirements analysis**: Understand what needs to be built/fixed
- **Architecture assessment**: Analyze existing codebase patterns
- **Task decomposition**: Break complex work into manageable chunks
- **Resource estimation**: Predict context usage and session requirements
- **Risk identification**: Spot potential blockers early

**Deliverables**:
- Detailed implementation plan
- Task priority matrix
- Resource allocation strategy
- Risk mitigation plan

### üîç Research Phase
**Goal**: Comprehensive understanding with minimal context consumption

**Key Activities**:
- **Codebase exploration**: Map relevant files and patterns
- **Dependency analysis**: Understand component relationships
- **Pattern identification**: Find existing solutions and approaches
- **Constraint mapping**: Document limitations and requirements
- **Best practice review**: Align with Care Collective guidelines

**Deliverables**:
- Comprehensive codebase map
- Implementation patterns documented
- Constraint and requirement matrix
- Recommended approaches

### üöÄ Production Phase
**Goal**: Focused implementation with maximum efficiency

**Key Activities**:
- **Systematic implementation**: Follow planned approach strictly
- **Quality assurance**: Test and validate as you build
- **Progress tracking**: Update status in real-time
- **Documentation updates**: Maintain current project state
- **Integration testing**: Ensure new code works with existing system

**Deliverables**:
- Working implementation
- Updated tests and documentation
- Progress status updates
- Integration verification

## PRP Method Application

### For New Features

#### Planning Phase (Context: 15-25%)
```markdown
1. Analyze feature requirements and user stories
2. Map integration points with existing system
3. Break down into implementable components
4. Estimate effort and identify dependencies
5. Create implementation roadmap
```

#### Research Phase (Context: 20-30%)
```markdown
1. Study existing similar implementations
2. Identify reusable patterns and components
3. Document technical constraints and requirements
4. Map data flow and component interactions
5. Validate approach with existing architecture
```

#### Production Phase (Context: 45-65%)
```markdown
1. Implement components following established patterns
2. Write tests for new functionality
3. Update documentation and type definitions
4. Integrate with existing codebase
5. Validate complete feature functionality
```

### For Bug Fixes

#### Planning Phase (Context: 10-15%)
```markdown
1. Reproduce and isolate the issue
2. Analyze root cause and impact scope
3. Identify affected components and dependencies
4. Plan minimal-impact resolution strategy
```

#### Research Phase (Context: 15-25%)
```markdown
1. Study relevant code sections
2. Understand data flow and component interactions
3. Research similar issues and solutions
4. Validate proposed fix approach
```

#### Production Phase (Context: 60-75%)
```markdown
1. Implement targeted fix
2. Add regression tests
3. Verify fix doesn't break related functionality
4. Update relevant documentation
```

### For Refactoring

#### Planning Phase (Context: 25-35%)
```markdown
1. Identify refactoring goals and success metrics
2. Map all affected components and dependencies
3. Plan incremental refactoring strategy
4. Identify backward compatibility requirements
5. Create rollback plan
```

#### Research Phase (Context: 20-30%)
```markdown
1. Analyze current architecture patterns
2. Research modern best practices
3. Identify reusable patterns and abstractions
4. Map migration path for existing functionality
```

#### Production Phase (Context: 35-50%)
```markdown
1. Implement refactoring incrementally
2. Maintain functionality throughout process
3. Update tests and documentation continuously
4. Validate performance and behavior
```
