# Production Phase: Focused Implementation & Quality Delivery

## Overview

The Production Phase is where planning and research transform into working code. This phase typically consumes 45-75% of available context and focuses on efficient, high-quality implementation that follows established patterns and meets Care Collective's community safety standards.

## Core Objectives

### 1. Systematic Implementation
- **Follow established patterns** discovered in research phase
- **Implement incrementally** with regular validation points
- **Maintain code quality** throughout development process
- **Ensure integration compatibility** with existing system

### 2. Quality Assurance
- **Test as you build** to catch issues early
- **Validate accessibility** at each implementation step
- **Ensure security compliance** with Care Collective standards
- **Maintain documentation** currency

### 3. Progress Tracking
- **Update status continuously** to track advancement
- **Identify blockers quickly** and address them
- **Maintain context efficiency** by staying focused
- **Document lessons learned** for future sessions

## Production Strategies

### 1. Incremental Implementation
```markdown
## Incremental Development Pattern

### Phase 1: Core Structure (20-30% of implementation)
- [ ] Create basic component/service structure
- [ ] Implement core data models and types
- [ ] Set up basic validation and error handling
- [ ] Create foundational tests

### Phase 2: Core Functionality (40-50% of implementation)
- [ ] Implement main business logic
- [ ] Add integration with existing services
- [ ] Enhance validation and security measures
- [ ] Expand test coverage

### Phase 3: Polish & Integration (20-30% of implementation)
- [ ] Add accessibility enhancements
- [ ] Optimize performance
- [ ] Complete documentation
- [ ] Final integration testing
```

### 2. Quality Gates
```markdown
## Quality Gate Checkpoints

## Context Optimization

### Production Efficiency Tips
1. **Stay focused**: Resist scope creep during implementation
2. **Test incrementally**: Don't wait until the end to test
3. **Follow patterns**: Use established patterns rather than inventing new ones
4. **Document as you go**: Update documentation continuously
5. **Validate frequently**: Check quality gates throughout development

### Context Recovery Strategies
When context runs low during production:
1. **Prioritize core functionality**: Complete working implementation first
2. **Defer polish items**: Basic accessibility and documentation can wait
3. **Create handoff notes**: Document where you left off for next session
4. **Commit progress**: Save work frequently with good commit messages
