# Research Phase: Comprehensive Understanding & Pattern Analysis

## Overview

The Research Phase focuses on gaining deep understanding of the existing codebase, patterns, and constraints with maximum efficiency. This phase typically consumes 15-30% of available context but provides crucial insights that guide implementation decisions.

## Core Objectives

### 1. Codebase Comprehension
- **Map existing patterns** and architectural decisions
- **Understand data flows** and component relationships
- **Identify reusable components** and utilities
- **Document constraints** and limitations

### 2. Pattern Identification
- **Find proven solutions** to similar problems
- **Analyze successful implementations** within the codebase
- **Identify anti-patterns** to avoid
- **Document best practices** already in use

### 3. Implementation Validation
- **Validate planned approach** against existing architecture
- **Identify integration opportunities** with current system
- **Spot potential conflicts** early
- **Refine implementation strategy** based on findings

## Research Strategies

### 1. Strategic File Reading
```markdown
### File Reading Priority Matrix

**High Priority** (Read in detail):
- Core files directly related to implementation
- Similar existing implementations
- Key utilities and patterns
- Configuration and setup files

**Medium Priority** (Scan for patterns):
- Related components and services
- Test files for understanding usage
- Documentation and comments
- Type definitions

**Low Priority** (Reference only):
- Tangentially related files
- Old implementations
- Generated files
- Third-party dependencies
```

### 2. Pattern Mining Techniques
```markdown
### Effective Pattern Mining

2. **Pattern over detail**: Understand patterns rather than memorizing specifics
3. **Document insights**: Record key findings to avoid re-research
4. **Question assumptions**: Validate planning phase assumptions

### Context Allocation
- **Core understanding**: 60-70% of research context
- **Pattern identification**: 20-30% of research context
- **Constraint mapping**: 10-20% of research context
