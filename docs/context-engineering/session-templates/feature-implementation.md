## Context Management Tips

### Efficient Context Usage
1. **Stay Focused**: Resist scope creep during implementation
2. **Use Existing Patterns**: Don't reinvent solutions
3. **Test Incrementally**: Validate as you build
4. **Document Decisions**: Record important choices
5. **Commit Frequently**: Save progress regularly

### When Context Runs Low
1. **Prioritize Core**: Complete working functionality first
2. **Defer Polish**: Styling and minor improvements can wait
3. **Document State**: Record where you left off
4. **Plan Next**: Set up next session for success
