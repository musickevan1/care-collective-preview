## Core Principles

### 1. Context Efficiency
- **Minimize token usage** through strategic planning
- **Batch related tasks** to maintain coherent context
- **Document progress** to preserve knowledge across sessions

### 2. PRP Methodology
- **Planning**: Strategic analysis and task breakdown
- **Research**: Comprehensive codebase analysis and requirements gathering
- **Production**: Focused implementation with minimal context waste

### 3. Master Planning System
- **Always-updated status** tracking for project health
- **Dynamic TODO management** linked to actual code
- **Phase dependencies** and resource allocation
- **Success metrics** and completion criteria

## Usage Guidelines

### For Development Sessions
1. **Start with Master Plan**: Check current status and next priorities
2. **Use Phase Plans**: Reference specific phase documentation for context
3. **Apply PRP Method**: Follow structured approach for complex tasks
4. **Update Status**: Maintain real-time progress tracking

### For New Features
1. **Planning Phase**: Use planning templates and methodology
2. **Research Phase**: Analyze existing codebase and requirements
3. **Production Phase**: Implement with focused, efficient sessions

### For Bug Fixes
1. **Quick Assessment**: Use session templates for rapid context setup
2. **Targeted Research**: Focus on specific areas without losing context
3. **Efficient Resolution**: Apply fixes with minimal scope creep

## Integration with CLAUDE.md

This context engineering system integrates with the main CLAUDE.md file to provide:
- **Strategic guidance** for development decisions
- **Efficient context management** for AI-assisted development
- **Progress tracking** and project health monitoring
- **Best practices** for Care Collective platform development

## Getting Started

1. **Read the Master Plan** (`master-plan.md`) for current project status
2. **Review PRP Method** (`prp-method/README.md`) for methodology overview
3. **Check Phase Plans** for specific implementation guidance
4. **Use Session Templates** for efficient development sessions

## Maintenance

This documentation should be updated:
- **After each development session** - Update master plan status
- **When starting new phases** - Create new phase plan documents
- **When methodologies evolve** - Update PRP method documentation
- **When templates improve** - Enhance session templates
