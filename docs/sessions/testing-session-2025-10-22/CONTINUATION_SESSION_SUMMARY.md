# Testing Continuation Session - Quick Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-22
**Duration**: ~30 minutes
**Status**: üî¥ BLOCKED - Deployment issue identified and documented

---

## What Happened

I resumed comprehensive testing as requested and immediately verified the Terms of Service checkbox issue on the production signup page.

### Critical Finding

‚úÖ **Root cause identified**: The production deployment at `care-collective-preview.vercel.app` is serving a **stale cached build** from BEFORE commit c64d783 (when the Terms checkbox was added).

---

## Evidence

1. ‚úÖ Source code contains checkbox (lines 267-300 in `app/signup/page.tsx`)
2. ‚ùå Production DOM shows NO checkbox element
3. ‚ùå Production only shows 4 inputs instead of 6
4. ‚ùå Button is enabled (should be disabled without terms)

## Investigation Results

**Explore Agent** completed comprehensive investigation:
- Timeline analyzed: c64d783 ‚Üí e75f6ab ‚Üí d37118b (current deployment)
- Current deployment ID: `dpl_5VH11nfcwM9uzLKsoWs5KAey9XGZ`
- Created: Today at 3:09 PM (18 minutes before testing)
- Issue: Vercel build cache not cleared despite `rm -rf .next` in vercel.json

**Pattern identified**: "Selective non-rendering" - fields added BEFORE c64d783 render fine, those added AFTER don't appear. Classic stale deployment cache behavior.

---

## Solution

### Immediate Fix

```bash
npx vercel --prod --force
```

This will force Vercel to:
- Clear build cache completely
- Rebuild from fresh .next directory
- Deploy the latest commit to production

### Verification After Deployment

1. Navigate to https://care-collective-preview.vercel.app/signup
2. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
3. Verify checkbox visible with sage/20 background border
4. Verify button disabled when unchecked, enabled when checked
5. Test that form won't submit without checking the box

---

## Testing Status

### Completed
- ‚úÖ Phase 1: Public pages (100%)

- üî¥ Phase 4: Admin panel
- üî¥ Phase 5-8: All remaining phases

**Overall Progress**: 25% complete

## Next Steps

### For Evan

1. **Deploy the fix**: Run `npx vercel --prod --force`
2. **Verify deployment**: Use `npx vercel inspect` to confirm latest commit
3. **Manual test**: Check signup page shows checkbox
4. **Notify testing agent**: Ready to resume comprehensive testing

### For Testing Agent

Resume from Phase 2.2 (Login & Waitlist) once deployment is verified.

---

## Key Insight

This is NOT a code issue - the code is complete and correct. This is a **deployment cache issue** where Vercel served stale artifacts despite the build cache configuration added in d37118b. The `--force` flag should resolve this by bypassing all caching layers.
