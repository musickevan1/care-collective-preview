**Discovered During**: Comprehensive Platform Testing Session
**Date**: 2025-10-22
**Tester**: Claude (Automated Testing)
**Status**: BLOCKING - Testing Paused

## Issue Summary

The signup form at `/signup` is completely missing the required Terms of Service acceptance checkbox. This is a critical compliance and legal issue.

---

## Issue Details

**Severity**: üî¥ CRITICAL
**Type**: Bug / Legal Compliance
**Page**: https://care-collective-preview.vercel.app/signup
**Device**: Desktop (1280x720)

### Description
The signup form does not include a checkbox for users to explicitly agree to the Terms of Service before creating an account. This violates platform documentation requirements and standard legal practices.

### Current Form Fields
1. ‚úÖ Full Name (required)
2. ‚úÖ Email Address (required)
3. ‚úÖ Password (required)
4. ‚úÖ Location (Optional)
5. ‚úÖ Why do you want to join? (Optional)
6. ‚ùå **MISSING: Terms of Service agreement checkbox**

### Expected Behavior
According to CLAUDE.md testing documentation (Phase 2.1):
> "Verify terms checkbox requirement"

The form should include:
- A required checkbox with text similar to: "I agree to the Terms of Service"
- Link to `/terms` page for users to review terms
- Form validation preventing submission without checkbox being checked
- Clear visual indication that this field is required

### Evidence
- Screenshot: `.playwright-mcp/testing-session-2025-10-22/phase2-01-signup-page-empty.png`
- Page URL: https://care-collective-preview.vercel.app/signup
- Console message: `[VERBOSE] [DOM] Input elements should have autocomplete attributes (suggested: "current-password")`

### Impact Assessment

#### Legal/Compliance Risks
- Users can create accounts without explicit ToS consent
- No audit trail of agreement to terms
- Potential liability if disputes arise
- Violates standard web platform practices

#### User Experience Impact
- Users may not be aware of community standards
- No clear indication of what they're agreeing to
- Missing educational opportunity about platform rules

#### Platform Integrity
- Community standards enforcement unclear
- No basis for account suspension/termination
- Undermines trust and safety mechanisms

### Related Documentation
- Terms of Service page exists at `/terms` (confirmed working)
- CLAUDE.md explicitly requires this validation
- Community Standards outlined in ToS and About page
