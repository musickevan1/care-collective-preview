## Important Notes

### Deployment Workflow (MANDATORY)
```bash
# After code changes, ALWAYS:
git add .
git commit -m "description ðŸ¤– Generated with Claude Code"
git push origin main
npx vercel --prod  # Required to update production!
```

### Cache Headers Fixed
- HTML pages now use `max-age=0, must-revalidate`
- Static assets still cached for 1 year (content-hashed)
- Users always see latest version
- No more "clear your cache" needed

### Playwright Browser Cache
**Important**: If testing shows old content:
1. Close browser: `mcp__playwright__browser_close`
2. Navigate with cache-buster: `?nocache=true` parameter
3. Or use fresh browser session
