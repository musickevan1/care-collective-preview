## Technical Decisions

### Why 7 Categories Instead of 12?
1. **Reduced Complexity:** Users can find what they need faster
2. **Natural Groupings:** Similar requests grouped together (e.g., childcare + petcare → household-yard)
3. **Subcategories Provide Granularity:** Don't lose specificity
4. **Easier to Filter:** Fewer options = better UX
5. **Client Preference:** Aligned with provided content

### Why Subcategories Optional?
1. **Flexibility:** Not all requests fit neatly into subcategories
2. **Lower Friction:** Don't force users to choose if unsure
3. **Better Than "Other":** More specific than just selecting "Other"
4. **Progressive Enhancement:** Can add more later

### Why Conditional Subcategory Dropdown?
1. **Cleaner UI:** Only show when relevant
2. **Reduces Overwhelm:** Fewer fields initially
3. **Better Mobile UX:** Less scrolling
4. **Clear Context:** Dropdown appears after category selection

### Why Required Terms Checkbox?
1. **Legal Protection:** Documented acceptance
2. **User Awareness:** Forces acknowledgment
3. **Version Tracking:** Can update terms later
4. **Industry Standard:** Common pattern users expect

## Next Steps (Not Started)

### Medium Priority - Backend Heavy

#### 1. Geographic Filtering
**Goal:** Restrict to 30-mile radius from Springfield, MO + waitlist

**Implementation Plan:**
- Add PostGIS extension to Supabase
- Store lat/lng with user profiles
- Geocode user locations on signup
- Calculate distance on help request queries
- Show waitlist page for users outside radius
- Admin panel to approve geographic exceptions

**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 hours

**Files to Create/Modify:**
- `lib/geo/geocoding.ts` - Geocoding service
- `lib/geo/distance.ts` - Distance calculation
- `app/waitlist-geographic/page.tsx` - Geographic waitlist page
- Migration for lat/lng fields
- Update signup flow
- Update help request queries

#### 2. Expiration Reminder System
**Goal:** Email reminders 7 days before expiration + auto-close

**Implementation Plan:**
- Set up email service (Resend or SendGrid)
- Create email templates
- Set up cron job (Vercel Cron or Supabase Edge Function)
- Send 7-day warning emails
- Auto-close expired requests
- Allow users to extend/mark complete

**Estimated Effort:** 4-5 hours

**Files to Create/Modify:**
- `lib/email/templates/expiration-reminder.tsx` - Email template
- `lib/email/send.ts` - Email sending service
- `app/api/cron/check-expirations/route.ts` - Cron job
- `supabase/functions/check-expirations/index.ts` - Alternative: Edge Function
- Update help_requests queries to handle expired status

**Dependencies:**
- Email service account (Resend recommended)
- Cron configuration
- Email templates

## References

**Client Content:**
- `docs/client/Send_to_Evan_Content.md` - Category definitions, community standards
- `docs/client/Resources_Page.md` - Community resources (already implemented)

**Previous Sessions:**
- `docs/sessions/session-2025-10-22.md` - Morning session (logo, pages, navigation)

**Project Documentation:**
- `CLAUDE.md` - Project guidelines
- `PROJECT_STATUS.md` - Overall status
- `docs/context-engineering/master-plan.md` - Architecture plan

---

## Success Metrics

✅ **All High Priority Tasks Completed (7/7)**
✅ **Zero Build Errors**
✅ **Zero TypeScript Errors** (in new code)
✅ **Deployed Successfully**
✅ **All Features Tested Live**
✅ **User Experience Enhanced**
✅ **Legal Compliance Improved**
✅ **Data Integrity Maintained**
✅ **Code Quality Maintained** (DRY, centralized constants)
✅ **Documentation Complete**

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Vercel Deployment Propagation:** Main domain takes ~10 seconds to update after deployment
2. **Client-Side Caching:** Use cache-busting query params for testing (`?v=2`)
3. **Migration Testing:** Always test with seed data to catch category mismatches
4. **Playwright Timeouts:** Network-dependent screenshots may timeout (not critical)
5. **Subcategory UX:** Conditional dropdowns work well for optional categorization

---

## Notes for Next Session

1. Both remaining tasks are backend-heavy and independent
2. Geographic filtering requires PostGIS setup
3. Expiration reminders require email service configuration
4. Consider which to prioritize based on client needs
5. Both can be implemented in parallel if needed
6. Test thoroughly in development before deploying

**Session End Time:** October 22, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Handoff:** Ready for next session
