---

## üîÑ In Progress

### Update Help Request Form
**File:** `app/requests/new/page.tsx`

**Current State:** Still uses old hardcoded categories (lines 15-28)

2. Replace hardcoded `categories` array
3. Add subcategory dropdown that appears after category selection
4. Populate subcategory options based on selected category
5. Add "This is an ongoing request" checkbox
6. Update form state to include `subcategory` and `is_ongoing`
7. Update submission handler to send new fields

**Validation:** Already updated in `lib/validations.ts`

---

## üìã Remaining Tasks

### 1. Terms of Service Page (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Create:** `app/terms/page.tsx`

**Content Source:** `docs/client/Send_to_Evan_Content.md` lines 96-114

**Should Include:**
- Community Standards
- Terms of Use
- Privacy & Safety
- Liability waiver mention (client question pending)

**Estimated Effort:** 30 minutes

---

### 2. Community Standards Checkbox on Signup (HIGH PRIORITY)
**File to Modify:** `app/signup/page.tsx`

**Required Changes:**
1. Add checkbox state: `const [termsAccepted, setTermsAccepted] = useState(false)`
2. Add Checkbox component import from `@/components/ui/checkbox`
3. Add checkbox field before submit button:
   ```tsx
   <Checkbox
     checked={termsAccepted}
     onCheckedChange={(checked) => setTermsAccepted(!!checked)}
     required
   />
   <label>
     I agree to follow the CARE Collective's Community Standards...
     <Link href="/terms">View Terms</Link>
   </label>
   ```
4. Validate checkbox is checked before submission
5. Include `terms_accepted_at: new Date().toISOString()` in user metadata
6. Include `terms_version: '1.0'` in user metadata

**Database Fields:** Already added in migration (profiles table)

**Estimated Effort:** 45 minutes

---

### 3. Geographic Filtering (BACKEND HEAVY)
**Requirement:** 30-mile radius from Springfield, MO + expansion waitlist

**Client Notes (line 166):** "30-mile radius from Springfield + waitlist for expansion"

**Files to Create/Modify:**
- Add `zip_code` field to profiles (new migration)
- Create geocoding utility or use ZIP code distance library
- Update signup to require ZIP code
- Filter help requests by distance in `/requests` page
- Create waitlist table for users outside radius
- Add admin view for waitlist

**Technical Considerations:**
- ZIP code validation
- Distance calculation (haversine formula or library)
- Performance impact on queries

**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 hours

---

### 4. Request Expiration Reminder System (BACKEND HEAVY)
**Requirement:** Auto-expire after 30 days, send reminder 7 days before

**Database:** Trigger already created in migration

**Needed:**
1. Scheduled function (Supabase Edge Function or cron job)
2. Email service integration (e.g., Resend, SendGrid)
3. Reminder email template
4. Auto-close logic for expired requests

**Two Functions Needed:**
- **Reminder Job:** Runs daily, finds requests expiring in 7 days, sends emails
- **Expiration Job:** Runs daily, finds expired requests, closes them

**Files to Create:**
- `supabase/functions/send-expiration-reminders/index.ts`
- `supabase/functions/auto-close-expired-requests/index.ts`
- Email templates

**Estimated Effort:** 4-5 hours

---

## ü§î Pending Client Clarifications

### 1. Emergency/Crisis Handling
**Question:** "How would we find out about these? What examples?" (line 92)

**Status:** Unanswered

**Impact:** May need to define protocol for urgent/critical requests

---

### 2. Background Checks vs Verification
**Question:** "Could verification replace background checks for some tasks?" (line 123)

**Status:** Unanswered

**Impact:** May affect signup flow and user verification features

---

### 3. Liability Waiver
**Mentioned:** Line 140 - "Did we talk about having them sign a waiver? I think that would be an important step."

**Status:** No waiver text provided

**Impact:** Should be added to Terms of Service page
