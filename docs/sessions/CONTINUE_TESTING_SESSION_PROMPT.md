# Continue Comprehensive Testing Session - Start Here

**Previous Session**: 2025-10-22 (25% complete)
**Status**: Paused due to deployment/checkbox issues
**Resume From**: Phase 2.2 - Login & Waitlist Testing

---

## üìã Quick Context

You were conducting a comprehensive platform testing session for Care Collective at `https://care-collective-preview.vercel.app`.

**Progress**:
- ‚úÖ Phase 1 Complete: All public pages tested
- ‚úÖ Phase 2.1 Complete: Signup form validation tested
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Paused: Discovered critical Terms checkbox deployment issues

**Critical Issue**: Terms of Service checkbox on signup page appears/disappears intermittently despite being in codebase.

---

## üéØ Your Mission

Resume comprehensive testing from Phase 2.2 onwards.

### Before You Start Testing:

#### 1. Verify Signup Page Fix
**CRITICAL**: The Terms checkbox was missing on some deployments. First verify it's now working:

```bash
# Navigate to signup page and check
https://care-collective-preview.vercel.app/signup
```

**What to check**:
- [ ] Terms of Service checkbox is visible
- [ ] Links to "Community Standards" and "Terms of Service" work
- [ ] Form cannot submit without checking the box
- [ ] Button is disabled when unchecked, enabled when checked

**If checkbox is missing**:
1. Check the latest deployment with: `npx vercel inspect care-collective-preview.vercel.app`
2. Note the deployment URL
3. Report this to Evan immediately
4. **DO NOT** continue testing until resolved

**If checkbox is present**:
‚úÖ Take a screenshot for documentation
‚úÖ Proceed with testing

## üîë Test Credentials

- Rejected user account (for access testing)

**Or state**: "I can create test accounts as needed during signup flow testing"

---

## üì∏ Documentation Requirements

For EVERY page/feature tested:
1. **Take screenshots** before interacting
2. **Document console errors** immediately
3. **Note positive findings** (what works well)
4. **Test forms** with valid AND invalid data
5. **Check mobile responsiveness**

**Save screenshots to**: `.playwright-mcp/testing-session-2025-10-22/`

**Naming convention**: `phase[X]-[NN]-[description].png`

---

## üêõ Known Issues (Don't Re-Report)

1. **Logo preload warning** - All pages, low priority
2. **Autocomplete attributes missing** - Password fields, low priority
3. **Resources page = Crisis Resources page** - Same content, noted

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Important Deployment Notes

**From previous session learnings**:

1. **Main production URL**: `https://care-collective-preview.vercel.app`
2. **This URL only updates** with `npx vercel --prod`
3. **Preview URLs** (musickevan1s-projects.vercel.app) auto-deploy on git push
4. **If you see old code**: It's likely a deployment/cache issue, not a bug

**Deployment verification command**:
```bash
npx vercel inspect care-collective-preview.vercel.app
```

- [ ] Captured all relevant screenshots
- [ ] Documented all issues found

---

## üö® Stop Testing If:

1. **Checkbox disappears again** - Critical deployment issue
2. **Site is completely down** - Infrastructure issue
3. **Can't login with provided credentials** - Account issue
4. **Build/deployment errors** - Need dev intervention

Report these immediately and wait for resolution.

---

## üìû Communication

**When you find issues**:
- Document in real-time using issue template
- Take screenshots immediately
- Note console errors
- Capture network tab if relevant

**When you complete a phase**:
- Update TODO list

- Summarize findings briefly

---

## üé¨ Start Command

When ready to begin, say:

**"Resume comprehensive testing from Phase 2.2 - starting with verification of Terms checkbox fix, then proceeding to Login and Waitlist testing."**

Then I'll:
1. Open Playwright browser

3. Continue systematic testing
4. Document everything thoroughly
