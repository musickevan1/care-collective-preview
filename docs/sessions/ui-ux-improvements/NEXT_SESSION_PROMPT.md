# Next Session: Testing UI/UX Improvements

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

Use this prompt to start the testing session:

```
We just completed implementing 10 UI/UX improvements to the Care Collective platform.
All features have been deployed to production. Now we need to test them thoroughly.

Please execute the comprehensive testing plan located at:
docs/sessions/ui-ux-improvements/TESTING_PLAN.md

Use Playwright MCP to run automated tests for all features:
- Group 1: Homepage Content & Navigation (5 features)
- Group 2: UI Component Cleanup (3 features)  
- Group 3: Navigation & Dashboard Fixes (2 features)

Production URL: https://care-collective-preview.vercel.app

Start with automated Playwright tests, then perform manual accessibility and
responsive testing. Document all results and create bug reports if issues found.

Let's aim to complete all testing in one session (~60-90 minutes).
```
