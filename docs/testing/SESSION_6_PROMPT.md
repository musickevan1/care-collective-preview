# Session 6: Test Browse Requests Fix & Continue

**Priority:** P0 - VERIFICATION
**Previous Session:** Session 5 (FilterPanel fix deployed, logged in ready to test)
**Status:** Ready to test - One command away from potential Bug #1 completion

---

## üöÄ Quick Start (30 seconds)

**YOU ARE ALREADY LOGGED IN FROM SESSION 5!**

Playwright browser is at: https://care-collective-preview.vercel.app/dashboard

### Step 1: Navigate to Browse Requests
```
Use Playwright MCP: browser_navigate
URL: https://care-collective-preview.vercel.app/requests
```

### Step 2: Check Result
Use Playwright MCP: `browser_snapshot`

**Expected:** ‚úÖ Page loads with help request cards showing real names
**Or:** ‚ùå Still shows "Something Went Wrong" error

---

## ‚úÖ Success Path: Page Works!

### Celebrate! üéâ
Bug #1 is FIXED after 8 hours across 4 sessions!

### Cleanup Tasks (10 minutes)
1. Remove diagnostic endpoint:
   ```bash
   rm app/api/test-browse/route.ts
   git add app/api/test-browse/route.ts
   git commit -m "üßπ CLEANUP: Remove diagnostic endpoint - Bug #1 verified fixed"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. Update `docs/testing/MASTER_FIX_PLAN.md`:
   - Mark Bug #1 as ‚úÖ FIXED
   - Add completion date: October 14, 2025
   - Note: Fixed by making FilterPanel callback optional

3. Close Playwright browser

### Move to Bug #2 (1.5-2 hours)
**Priority:** P0 - Privacy page not rendering
**Estimated Time:** 1-2 hours (likely similar RLS/query issue)

Navigate to: https://care-collective-preview.vercel.app/privacy
Apply same debugging methodology as Bug #1

---

## ‚ùå Failure Path: Page Still Fails

### Immediate Actions

1. **Check console messages** - Playwright will show actual errors

2. **Add verbose error logging**
   Edit `app/requests/page.tsx` to wrap rendering in try-catch with detailed logging

3. **Test components individually**
   - Isolate which component is failing
   - Check FilterPanel, PlatformLayout, Card components

4. **Check for type errors**
   Run: `npm run type-check`
