# Session 5: Browse Requests Debug - Summary

**Date:** October 14, 2025
**Duration:** ~3 hours
**Status:** üü° **IN PROGRESS** - Logged in successfully, need to test /requests page

---

## üéØ Session Goal
Fix Bug #1: Browse Requests page returning 500 Server Components render error

---

## ‚úÖ What We Accomplished

### 1. Identified Root Cause Was NOT Cache
- Ruled out Vercel caching issue (manual cache purge didn't help)
- Confirmed environment variables are set correctly (`SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE` exists)
- Verified queries work successfully (Supabase logs show 200 responses)

### 2. Fixed FilterPanel Type Issue
**Problem:** FilterPanel component required `onFilterChange` callback but Browse Requests page passed empty function
**Solution:** Made `onFilterChange` optional in FilterPanel
**Files Modified:**
- `components/FilterPanel.tsx` - Made callback optional with `?` operator
- `app/requests/page.tsx` - Removed empty callback and unused import

**Commits:**
- `a5d8c46` - Make FilterPanel onFilterChange optional
- `e5103de` - Remove unused FilterOptions import

### 3. Successfully Logged In with Playwright
- Used Playwright MCP to automate login
- Logged in as: test.approved.final@carecollective.test
- Currently on dashboard at: https://care-collective-preview.vercel.app/dashboard

---

## ‚è∏Ô∏è Where We Left Off

**Current State:**
- ‚úÖ Logged into production as approved user
- ‚úÖ Dashboard loads successfully (showing "Welcome back, Test Approved User!")
- ‚è∏Ô∏è **NEXT STEP:** Navigate to `/requests` page to test if the fix worked

**Test Needed:**
Navigate to https://care-collective-preview.vercel.app/requests while logged in and check:
- Does page load without 500 error?
- Are help request cards displayed?
- Are real names showing (not "Anonymous")?

---

## üîç Debugging Journey

### Attempt #1: Wait for Vercel Cache to Clear
- **Action:** Waited 30+ minutes for edge function cache
- **Result:** ‚ùå Still failing

### Attempt #2: Manual Cache Purge
- **Action:** User clicked "Purge Data Cache" in Vercel dashboard
- **Result:** ‚ùå Still failing

### Attempt #3: Force Rebuild
- **Action:** Made trivial code change and redeployed
- **Result:** ‚ùå Still failing

### Attempt #4: Environment Variable Check
- **Action:** Verified `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE` exists in Vercel
- **Result:** ‚úÖ Env var exists, not the issue

### Attempt #5: Fix FilterPanel Type Issue
- **Action:** Made `onFilterChange` optional in FilterPanel
- **Result:** ‚è∏Ô∏è Deployed, awaiting test

---

## üìä Evidence & Logs

### Supabase Logs Confirm Queries Work
Recent successful queries from authenticated users:
```
‚úÖ GET /rest/v1/help_requests?select=*&order=created_at.desc&limit=100 | 200
‚úÖ GET /rest/v1/profiles?select=id,name,location&id=in.(...) | 200
```

### Separate Queries Pattern is Deployed
The optimized query function in `lib/queries/help-requests-optimized.ts`:
1. Fetches help_requests (no JOIN)
2. Fetches profiles separately
3. Merges in JavaScript

This pattern **IS** being executed successfully (logs confirm).

---

## üêõ Potential Root Causes (Still Investigating)

### Theory #1: FilterPanel Callback Type Mismatch ‚úÖ FIXED
- Server component passing empty function to client component
- **Fixed in commits a5d8c46 & e5103de**

### Theory #2: Component Rendering Error (Still Possible)
- Error happens AFTER data fetch completes
- Error is in JSX rendering logic somewhere
- Production hides detailed error messages

### Theory #3: Unknown Runtime Error
- Could be in PlatformLayout, FilterPanel, or card rendering
- Need to test while logged in to see actual behavior

---

## üìÅ Files Modified This Session

### Modified
1. `components/FilterPanel.tsx`
   - Line 56: Made `onFilterChange` optional
   - Line 122: Use optional chaining `onFilterChange?.()`
   - Line 146: Use optional chaining `onFilterChange?.()`

2. `app/requests/page.tsx`
   - Line 1: Added cache-clearing comment
   - Line 9: Removed `FilterOptions` from import
   - Lines 346-349: Removed empty callback from FilterPanel

---

## üéØ Next Session Priority

### Immediate Action (First 5 Minutes)
While logged in with Playwright, navigate to `/requests`:

```javascript
// In Playwright MCP
await page.goto('https://care-collective-preview.vercel.app/requests');
```

**Expected Outcomes:**

**‚úÖ SUCCESS CASE:** Page loads with help request cards
- See 8 help requests with real names
- Names: "Patricia Parent", "Mary Neighbor", "Robert Elder", etc.
- Filters and search work
- **Action:** Mark Bug #1 as FIXED, clean up diagnostic code, move to Bug #2

**‚ùå STILL FAILING:** 500 error persists
- Page shows "Something Went Wrong"
- Error is in component rendering, not data fetch
- **Action:** Add verbose error logging to identify exact component/line causing error

---

## üîß If Still Failing - Debug Plan

### Add Verbose Error Logging
Wrap each major component in error boundary with detailed logging:

```typescript
// app/requests/page.tsx
try {
  console.log('[RENDER] Starting FilterPanel render')
  const filterPanel = <FilterPanel className="mb-6" showAdvanced={false} />
  console.log('[RENDER] FilterPanel rendered successfully')

  console.log('[RENDER] Starting request cards render, count:', safeRequests.length)
  const cards = safeRequests.map(...)
  console.log('[RENDER] Cards rendered successfully')

  // etc.
} catch (error) {
  console.error('[RENDER ERROR]', error)
  throw error
}
```

### Check Browser Console
- Playwright console logs will show exact error
- Can pinpoint which component/line is failing

## üí° Key Learnings This Session

### 1. Server/Client Component Boundaries Are Tricky
- Client components used in server components need careful prop typing
- Optional callbacks are safer than required empty functions
- TypeScript doesn't always catch these at compile time

### 2. Production Error Hiding Is Aggressive
- Server Components errors are obfuscated in production for security
- Need authenticated testing to see real behavior
- Local dev server would have shown actual error (but had issues starting)

### 3. Automated Testing Needs Auth Context
- Unauthenticated browser tests only test redirect flows
- Need to actually log in to test protected pages
- Playwright MCP can handle authentication flows
