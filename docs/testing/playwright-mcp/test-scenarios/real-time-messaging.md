### Automated WebSocket Testing

```markdown
## Playwright MCP WebSocket Testing Patterns

### Connection Testing:
1. **WebSocket Establishment**:
   ```javascript
   () => {
     // Test WebSocket connection establishment
     return new Promise((resolve) => {
       const ws = new WebSocket(window.websocketUrl);
       ws.onopen = () => resolve({ status: 'connected', readyState: ws.readyState });
       ws.onerror = (error) => resolve({ status: 'error', error: error.message });
     });
   }
   ```

2. **Message Delivery Testing**:
   ```javascript
   () => {
     // Test message delivery timing
     const startTime = Date.now();
     window.sendTestMessage('Test message').then(() => {
       const deliveryTime = Date.now() - startTime;
       return { deliveryTime, messageDelivered: true };
     });
   }
   ```

3. **Connection Recovery Testing**:
   ```javascript
   () => {
     // Test connection recovery after interruption
     window.simulateNetworkInterruption().then(() => {
       return window.testConnectionRecovery();
