# Mobile Device Testing with Playwright MCP

This document provides comprehensive guidance for mobile-first testing of the Care Collective platform using Playwright MCP server's device simulation capabilities.

## Overview

Care Collective prioritizes mobile experience as community members primarily access the platform through mobile devices, especially during crisis situations. This testing framework ensures the platform works reliably across all mobile devices and usage scenarios.

## Mobile-First Testing Philosophy

### Real-World Mobile Usage Context
- **Crisis Accessibility**: People in need often have only mobile access
- **Diverse Devices**: Community includes users with older/budget devices
- **Network Constraints**: Rural Missouri areas may have limited connectivity
- **Accessibility Needs**: Mobile screen readers and assistive technologies
- **Touch Interactions**: Primary interaction method for mobile users

### Testing Priorities
1. **Core Functionality**: Help requests work on any mobile device
2. **Touch Accessibility**: All interactions work with touch and assistive tech
3. **Performance**: Platform responsive even on slower devices/networks
4. **Offline Resilience**: Graceful degradation with poor connectivity
5. **Cross-Platform**: Consistent experience across mobile operating systems
