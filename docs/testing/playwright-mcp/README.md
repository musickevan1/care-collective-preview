# Playwright MCP Integration for Care Collective

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for using the Playwright MCP (Model Context Protocol) server to test the Care Collective mutual aid platform.

## Overview

The Playwright MCP server enables sophisticated browser automation and end-to-end testing through Claude Code, providing comprehensive testing capabilities for:

- **User Journey Testing**: Complete workflows from request creation to resolution
- **Accessibility Compliance**: WCAG 2.1 AA validation with automated testing
- **Mobile Experience**: Device simulation and touch interaction testing
- **Privacy & Security**: Contact exchange and data protection verification
- **Real-time Features**: Messaging and moderation system testing

## Quick Start

1. **Ensure Playwright MCP is configured** in your Claude Code setup
2. **Review the [Integration Guide](./integration-guide.md)** for complete setup instructions
3. **Choose your test scenario** from the [test-scenarios](./test-scenarios/) directory
4. **Follow the examples** in the [examples](./examples/) directory

## Key Features

### Browser Automation
- **Real browser testing** with Chromium, Firefox, and Safari
- **Device simulation** for mobile and tablet testing
- **Network condition simulation** for various connectivity scenarios
- **Screenshot and video capture** for test documentation

### Accessibility Integration
- **Automated axe-core scanning** integrated into test flows
- **Keyboard navigation testing** for all interactive elements
- **Screen reader compatibility** verification
- **Color contrast and touch target** validation

### Privacy-First Testing
- **Contact information protection** validation
- **Data sanitization** verification
- **Consent flow testing** for sensitive operations
- **Audit trail verification** for security compliance

### Care Collective Specific Testing
- **Mutual aid workflow validation** for community safety
- **Urgency level handling** for critical requests
- **Geographic context testing** for Missouri communities
- **Community trust verification** through secure interactions

## Core Principles

### Community Safety First
All testing approaches prioritize the safety and privacy of community members, ensuring that test scenarios reflect real-world usage patterns while maintaining security.

### Accessibility Non-Negotiable
Every test scenario includes accessibility validation, ensuring WCAG 2.1 AA compliance is maintained across all features and interactions.

### Mobile-First Approach
Testing prioritizes mobile experience, reflecting the primary usage patterns of community members accessing the platform during crisis situations.

### Privacy by Design
All test scenarios include privacy validation, ensuring contact information and sensitive data remains protected throughout all user interactions.

## Integration with Existing Testing

This Playwright MCP integration complements the existing Vitest unit testing framework:

- **Unit Tests (Vitest)**: Component behavior and logic validation
- **E2E Tests (Playwright MCP)**: Complete user journey and integration testing
- **Accessibility Tests**: Integrated across both frameworks
- **Performance Tests**: Lighthouse integration for performance validation

## Getting Started

1. **Read the [Integration Guide](./integration-guide.md)** for complete setup
2. **Choose a test scenario** from the scenarios directory
3. **Run your first test** following the examples
4. **Customize for your needs** using the Care Collective patterns

## Support and Troubleshooting

- Check the [Troubleshooting Guide](./troubleshooting/common-issues.md) for common issues
- Review [debugging techniques](./troubleshooting/debugging-guide.md) for complex scenarios
- Reference the [examples](./examples/) directory for practical implementations
