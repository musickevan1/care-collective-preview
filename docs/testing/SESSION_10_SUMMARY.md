# Session 10 Summary: P1 Bug Fixes & WebSocket Improvements
**Date**: October 19, 2025
**Session Type**: Bug Fixing & Production Testing
**Duration**: ~4 hours

---

## 🎯 Session Goals
1. Fix Bug #5: Access-denied page 404 error
2. Fix Bug #6: Messaging WebSocket failures
3. Comprehensive production testing to find additional bugs
4. Deploy all fixes to production

---

## ✅ Bugs Fixed

### Bug #5: Access-Denied Page (404 Error) - ✅ VERIFIED FIXED
**Severity**: P1 - High
**File**: `app/access-denied/page.tsx`

**Issue**: Page returned 404 when middleware redirected users (rejected, not_admin, session_invalidated reasons)

**Root Cause**: Missing `searchParams` prop handling required by Next.js 14.2.32 App Router

**Fix Implemented**:
- Added `searchParams` prop as Promise (Next.js 14+ requirement)
- Made page async to await searchParams
- Implemented dynamic reason-based messaging:
  - `rejected` → Yellow UI: "Application Not Approved"
  - `not_admin` → Red UI: "Admin Access Required"
  - `session_invalidated` → Blue UI: "Session Expired"
  - Default → Yellow UI: "Access Denied"
- Added proper links (Contact Support, Return to Homepage, Back to Login)
- Maintained Care Collective branding with logo

**Status**: ✅ VERIFIED WORKING IN PRODUCTION

---

### Bug #6: Messaging WebSocket Reliability - ✅ CODE COMPLETE
**Severity**: P1 - High
**Files**: `lib/messaging/realtime.ts`, `hooks/useRealTimeMessages.ts`

**Issue**: WebSocket connections failed, no automatic reconnection, messages lost when offline

**Fixes Implemented**:

#### 1. Automatic Reconnection Logic (`realtime.ts`)
- Exponential backoff retry: 1s → 2s → 4s → 8s → 16s → 30s (max)
- Maximum 5 retry attempts before giving up
- Jitter added to prevent thundering herd problem
- Proper reconnection state tracking

#### 2. Comprehensive Error Handling (`realtime.ts`)
- Handles `CHANNEL_ERROR` status with reconnection
- Handles `TIMED_OUT` status with reconnection
- Handles `CLOSED` status with reconnection
- Proper error logging and user notification via callbacks
- Connection status exposed to UI components

#### 3. Network Status Integration (`realtime.ts`, `useRealTimeMessages.ts`)
- Integrates with existing `useNetworkStatus` hook
- Pauses subscriptions when network goes offline
- Auto-resumes subscriptions when network returns
- Provides `isOnline`, `connectionStatus`, and `networkStatus` to components

#### 4. Offline Message Queue (`useRealTimeMessages.ts`)
- Messages sent while offline are automatically queued
- Queue stored in component state with metadata (timestamp, retry count)
- Auto-sends queued messages when connection restored
- Retries failed messages up to 3 times
- Shows "sending..." status for queued messages in UI
- Graceful degradation for poor rural connectivity

**Status**: ✅ CODE COMPLETE - Will verify when messaging is actively used in production

---

### Bug #8: TypeScript Compilation Errors - ✅ VERIFIED FIXED
**Severity**: P2 - Medium
**File**: `app/requests/new/page.tsx`

**Issues**:
1. Type mismatch: `null` vs `undefined` for PlatformLayout user prop
2. Missing `name` property on Supabase User type

**Fixes**:
- Changed `null` to `undefined` for unauthenticated states
- Transformed Supabase User to PlatformLayout expected format:
  ```typescript
  const platformUser = user ? {
    id: user.id,
    name: user.user_metadata?.name || user.email?.split('@')[0] || 'User',
    email: user.email || ''
  } : undefined;
  ```

**Status**: ✅ VERIFIED - TypeScript compiles with 0 errors

---

## ⚠️ Partially Fixed / Remaining Issues

### Bug #7: Request Detail Page Server Error - ⚠️ PARTIAL FIX
**Severity**: P1 - High
**File**: `app/requests/[id]/page.tsx`

**Issue**: Server Component error when viewing individual help request details

**Attempted Fixes**:
1. ✅ Replaced RLS foreign key joins with separate queries (workaround for RLS limitations)
2. ✅ Added proper error handling and retry logic
3. ✅ Added fallback for null profile data
4. ❌ React hydration error #419 still persists in production

**Current Status**: ⚠️ PARTIAL - Browse requests page works, but detail pages have hydration mismatch

**Root Cause**: React error #419 indicates server/client HTML mismatch. Likely caused by:
- Dynamic import of ContactExchange with `ssr: false`
- Conditional rendering differences between server and client
- Production build hides specific error details

**Workaround**: Users can still:
- ✅ Browse all help requests (`/requests`)
- ✅ Create new requests (`/requests/new`)
- ✅ See request summaries in browse view
- ❌ Cannot view full request detail page

**Recommendation for Next Session**:
1. Remove `ssr: false` from ContactExchange dynamic import
2. Convert ContactExchange to proper Server Component compatible structure
3. Add better error boundary with development mode error details
4. Test with local development build to see full error message
