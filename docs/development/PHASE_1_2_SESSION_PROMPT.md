## üö® **Phase 1.2 Critical Tasks**

### **1.2.1 Production Error Tracking (HIGH PRIORITY)**

#### Replace Console.log Stubs with Production Service
**Problem:** `app/error.tsx` currently uses console.log stubs instead of real error tracking
**Location:** `app/error.tsx` line references in analysis
**Solution Required:**
- Implement production-ready error tracking service integration
- Choose appropriate service (Sentry, LogRocket, or similar)
- Replace all console.log error stubs with real tracking
- Add proper error classification and filtering
- Test error reporting in production-like environment

#### Key Implementation Points:
```typescript
// Current stub pattern to replace:
// console.log('Error captured:', error)

// Target implementation:
// errorTrackingService.captureError(error, {
//   context: 'care-collective-mutual-aid',
//   user: sanitizedUserInfo,
//   severity: determineSeverity(error)
// })
```

### **1.2.2 Structured Logging Infrastructure (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**

#### Implement Application-Wide Logging
**Current State:** Basic console logging throughout application
**Required Implementation:**
- Create structured logging service for Care Collective domain
- Add request/response logging for API routes
- Implement log aggregation strategy
- Set up alerting for critical errors affecting community members
- Ensure privacy compliance for mutual aid platform logging

#### Community-Specific Considerations:
- **Privacy-First Logging**: Never log contact information or sensitive mutual aid data
- **Urgency-Aware Alerting**: Critical alerts for urgent help requests system failures
- **Community Impact Tracking**: Log errors that affect help request creation/viewing

### **1.2.3 Production Monitoring Integration (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**

#### Enhance Error Boundary System
**Current:** Basic error boundaries implemented
**Enhancement Required:**
- Integrate error boundaries with production error tracking
- Add context-aware error reporting for Care Collective features
- Implement error recovery strategies for critical community features
- Add user-friendly error messages with community-appropriate language

#### Performance Error Monitoring
- Connect performance monitoring to error tracking
- Alert on performance degradation affecting help request workflows
- Monitor Core Web Vitals errors impacting community member experience

app/admin/*/page.tsx           # Admin error tracking
components/ContactExchange.tsx  # Privacy-critical error handling
```

### Configuration Files:
```
next.config.js                  # Error reporting configuration
package.json                   # Add error tracking dependencies
.env.local                     # Error tracking service configuration
