## 🎉 SESSION 6 - PHASE 2: TEST SUITE RECOVERY BREAKTHROUGH (January 2025)
**CRITICAL TEST INFRASTRUCTURE RECOVERY COMPLETED!**

### **Phase 2a: Component Interface Recovery ✅ COMPLETED**
**Major Milestone**: Test suite restored from complete compilation failure to **105 passing tests (32.5% pass rate)**

#### **Critical Fixes Completed**:
- ✅ **Component Interface Alignment**: Fixed ConversationList, MessageBubble, ContactExchange, MessagingDashboard prop mismatches
- ✅ **Test Fixture Schema Updates**: Aligned Message and Participant objects with current database schema
- ✅ **TypeScript Compilation**: Resolved critical compilation errors blocking test execution
- ✅ **Test Infrastructure**: Tests now run successfully - foundation established for further improvements

#### **Test Suite Status Transformation**:
- **Before**: Complete compilation failure - 0 tests running
- **After**: ✅ **105 tests passing**, 218 failing (**323 total tests running**)
- **Progress**: From 0% to **32.5% pass rate** in Phase 2a
- **Foundation**: Critical path unblocked - components compile and basic functionality validated

#### **Next Steps for 95% Target (285+ passing tests)**:
