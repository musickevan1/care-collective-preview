## Client Tone & Priorities

- Appreciates flexibility and understanding about visual uncertainty
- Values accessibility and clean design
- Wants warmer, more color-blocked aesthetic (like Kinderground)
- Open to adjustments: "just do whatever you think will be most impactful"
- Facebook page is work-in-progress (can be refined later)
