## üí¨ SUGGESTED EMAIL RESPONSE

```
Hi Maureen,

Thanks for the reminder! I'll submit the timesheet tonight. I haven't received confirmation on the last payment yet - could you check on that?

I'd love to touch base on the project. The preview site is running well at care-collective-preview.vercel.app with all core features working. We're at about 18 of the 20 hours, with messaging completion and Wix integration remaining.

Given your heavy workload, I'm happy to work at whatever pace suits you. The platform is stable and ready when you are.

Would you prefer a quick Zoom call or an email update on next steps?

Best,
Evan
```
