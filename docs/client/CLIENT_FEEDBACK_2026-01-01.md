Hi, Evan.

Happy new year! I hope you've and a nice break so far!

I looked at the new design, and I really love it! It looks very dynamic and welcoming. Thank you so much for working on that!

I've made a few additional suggestions here, but I am also happy to hop on a call if that's better. I am available tomorrow (1/2) after 1 PM or we could look at next week.

## Web Version Feedback

### Landing Page

#### Typography & Colors
- [ ] Make "Southwest Missouri" at the top of the hero section bigger (similar size to the subheading "Caregiver Assistance and Resource Exchange")
- [ ] Bump all body text up one level
- [ ] Consider darker body text color - currently fades on cream background
- [ ] Make section headings larger (e.g., "WHAT IS CARE COLLECTIVE") to fill their space more
- [ ] In "Who We Are" section: Make "Together, we are making caregiving sustainable" the same size/weight as the line above it

#### Hero Image
- [ ] Current image is too older-adult focused
- [ ] Want more community/peer-focused imagery
- [ ] Client is looking for free images but having difficulty finding suitable ones
- **Question:** Do you have a paid stock image subscription?

#### What Is CARE Collective Section
- [ ] Remove one of the two "Join" buttons - only need one

#### Who We Are Section
- [ ] Add "Founder" under Maureen's name

### Join Page
- [ ] Change subheading text to "Create an account below" or similar
- **Concern:** Current text "to start helping your community" may confuse people looking to receive help

### Resources Page
- [ ] Center the subheadings
- [ ] Update "Hospice" box to "Hospice Foundation for Outreach"

### Member Portal

#### Login Flow
- **Question:** Should login open to home page or go directly to dashboard?

#### Dashboard
- [ ] Make headings in the top boxes larger - currently overshadowed by buttons

#### Offer to Help Form
- [ ] Text on the popup form is too small
- [ ] "Your Message" example text is too vague
- [ ] Suggested example: "Hi. I think I can help! I am available most days after 5 PM" or something more specific
- **Note:** Instructions say "be specific" but example text doesn't demonstrate this

### Admin Panel
- [ ] Pending membership requests don't show enough information about people
- **Question:** Will more information be visible later?

---

## Mobile Version Feedback

- [ ] Most text still looks too small
- [ ] In "About CARE Collective" section: Move Maureen's photo to below "The Who We Are" part

### High Priority (Typography/Readability)
1. Increase font sizes across the board (hero, body, headings)
2. Darken body text color for better contrast on cream background
3. Fix mobile text sizing

### Medium Priority (Content/UX)
4. Update hero image to community/peer-focused
5. Simplify Join buttons (remove duplicate)
6. Update Join page subheading text
7. Fix Resources page (center headings, update Hospice name)

### Questions to Answer
