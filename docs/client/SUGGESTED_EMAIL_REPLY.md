**Subject:** Re: Time sheet due tonight

Hi Maureen,

Thanks for checking in! Classes have been going well, thanks for asking.

I'll get the timesheet submitted tonight before the deadline. I haven't received confirmation on payment for the last one yet, could you check on that when you get a chance?

I'd love to touch base on the CARE Collective project! Things have been progressing really well. The preview site at care-collective-preview.vercel.app is stable and all the core features are working smoothly. We're at about 18 of our 20 budgeted hours, so we're right on track.

Since your workload has been heavy with the rocky semester start, I've been taking my time to polish things rather than rush. The main remaining items are:
• Completing the in-app messaging feature (about 85% done)
• Creating the Wix landing page templates 
• Setting up the training materials for handoff

I'm flexible on timing given everything you're juggling. Would you prefer a quick Zoom call to walk through the current state, or would an email update work better for now? I'm happy to work at whatever pace fits your schedule.

Glad to hear you're seeing light at the end of the tunnel with the semester! Let me know what works best for you.

Best,
Evan

Hi Maureen,

The CARE Collective project is going great! The preview site is running smoothly at care-collective-preview.vercel.app with all core features working. We're at 18 of 20 hours and just have messaging completion and Wix integration left.

Given your heavy workload, I'm happy to work at your pace. Would you like a quick Zoom update or email summary of where we stand?

Best,
Evan
