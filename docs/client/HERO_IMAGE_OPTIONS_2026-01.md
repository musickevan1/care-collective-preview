## Alternative: Use Client's Image

If the client owns or has rights to the reference image (`Help with yard work.jpeg`), this could potentially be used directly. 

**Questions to ask:**
1. Is this image owned by CARE Collective?
2. Was it taken by a professional photographer with a release?
3. Do the subjects have model releases on file?

If yes to all, this image is an excellent candidate as it perfectly captures the desired aesthetic.
