## ‚ö†Ô∏è Outstanding Items & Decisions Needed

### 1. Background Check System

**Client Question from 10/12:**
> "If we required background checks for everyone, would this be necessary? Or could you see this taking the place of background checks for some tasks?"

**Current Status:** ‚ùå Not Implemented
**Technical Feasibility:**
- Can integrate with background check providers (Checkr, Sterling, etc.)
- Would require:
  - Budget for background check service ($15-40 per check)
  - Legal review of liability
  - Decision on which tasks require checks
  - Implementation time: 2-3 weeks

**Questions for Discussion:**
1. Budget available for background check service?
2. Which help request categories require background checks?
   - Health & Caregiving tasks?
   - Transportation (driving others)?
   - Household tasks in someone's home?
3. Should this be required for ALL members or task-specific?
4. Alternative: Verification through other means (phone, address)?

### 2. Geographic Radius Feature (30-mile limit)

**Client Request from 10/12:**
> "How about within a 30-mile radius from Springfield? How would we limit this, though?"

**Current Status:** ‚ùå Not Implemented
**Technical Approach Options:**

**Option A: Simple Zip Code Filtering** (Easiest, 1-2 days)
- Require zip code during signup
- Manually maintain list of allowed zip codes within 30 miles
- Pros: Simple, no API costs
- Cons: Manual maintenance, less precise

**Option B: Geographic Calculation** (Moderate, 3-5 days)
- Use zip code geocoding to calculate distance
- Automatically filter users outside radius
- Pros: Accurate, automated
- Cons: Requires geocoding API (~$5/month)

**Option C: Map-Based Selection** (Advanced, 1-2 weeks)
- Visual map for service area
- Users can see coverage area
- Pros: Best user experience, clear boundaries
- Cons: More complex, higher cost

**Waitlist Feature Suggestion:**
> "Interested in CARE Collective expanding to your area? Enter your email so we can notify you."

- ‚úÖ Can implement easily (1-2 days)
- Would track interest by location
- Good for grant reporting and expansion planning

**Questions for Discussion:**
1. Which geographic option fits your needs and budget?
2. Should we implement the expansion waitlist feature?
3. What's the center point for the 30-mile radius? (Downtown Springfield?)

### 3. Liability Waiver System

**Client Requirement from 10/12:**
> "Did we talk about having them sign a waiver? I think that would be an important step."

**Current Status:** ‚ùå Not Implemented
**Requirements:**
- Legal review of waiver language (recommend attorney review)
- Waiver storage and digital signature
- Display waiver during signup process
- Track waiver acceptance per user

**Implementation Time:** 3-5 days (after legal review)

**Questions for Discussion:**
1. Do you have existing waiver language from MSU legal team?
2. Should waiver be separate from Terms of Service checkbox?
3. Any specific liability concerns to address?

### 4. Help Request Expiration System

**Client Request from 10/12:**
> "Something along the lines of being able to mark a request as 'ongoing' and otherwise expiring in 30 days, maybe with a reminder one week prior, if that's not too complicated."

**Current Status:** ‚ùå Not Implemented
**Technical Plan:**
- Add "ongoing" flag to help requests
- Automatic reminder email 7 days before expiration
- Auto-close requests after 30 days (unless marked ongoing)
- Dashboard indicator for expiring requests

**Implementation Time:** 3-5 days

**Note:** This was in the client requirements but not yet implemented.

### 5. Impact Tracking & Analytics

**Client Request from 10/12:**
> "Do you want to track community impact (number of people helped, etc.)? Definitely!"

**Current Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially Implemented
**Currently Tracking:**
- Total help requests created
- Total users registered
- Request status (open/closed/in_progress)
- Contact exchanges initiated

**Not Yet Implemented:**
- Admin dashboard with analytics
- Impact metrics (people helped, hours contributed)
- Grant reporting features
- Export functionality for reports

**Implementation Time:** 1 week for full analytics dashboard
