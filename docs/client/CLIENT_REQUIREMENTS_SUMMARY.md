## ❓ Client Questions & Answers

### Help Request Management

**Q: What types of help requests do you want to encourage/discourage?**
> **A:** See revised list above. I wouldn't encourage/discourage any of them specifically.

**Q: How should we handle emergency or crisis situations?**
> **A:** How would we find out about these? Or is that your question? What examples of this can you think of?

**Q: Should there be limits on how often someone can request help?**
> **A:** I would say no off the bat. If something comes up, we can address it then.

**Q: Should help requests expire after a certain time?**
> **A:** Something along the lines of being able to mark a request as "ongoing" and otherwise expiring in 30 days, maybe with a reminder one week prior, if that's not too complicated.

### Verification & Safety

**Q: Do you want to verify community members somehow (address, phone, etc.)?**
> **A:** If we required background checks for everyone, would this be necessary? Or could you see this taking the place of background checks for some tasks?

**Q: Did we talk about having them sign a waiver?**
> **A:** I think that would be an important step.

**Q: Any categories you're concerned about from a liability perspective?**
> **A:** Did we talk about having them sign a waiver? I think that would be an important step.

### Categories

**Q: Are there specific categories important to Southwest Missouri we should add?**
> **A:** I don't think so as of now.

**Q: Should we include things like: yard work, pet care, technology help, job search assistance?**
> **A:** All except the final one [job search assistance].

### Administration

**Q: Who will be the primary administrators?**
> **A:** As of now, it will just be me and you.

**Q: How quickly do you want to respond to reported problems?**
> **A:** Maybe we could say, "Contact us at [email] with any concerns. We respond to safety issues within 24 hours and other inquiries within 2-3 business days."

**Q: Do you want to track community impact (number of people helped, etc.)?**
> **A:** Definitely!

### Launch Strategy

**Q: How many people do you want in the initial beta test?**
> **A:** I've found 5 people to test it before it goes live. Then the grant says I will recruit 15-20 caregivers in the first year.

**Q: Which communities should we start with? (Springfield, Branson, Joplin?)**
> **A:** How about within a 30-mile radius from Springfield? How would we limit this, though? I wonder if we could add a feature that says something like, "Interested in CARE Collective expanding to your area? Enter your email so we can notify you."

**Q: Do you have existing community groups we should invite first?**
> **A:** I was thinking I would distribute flyers at various locations around town (senior centers, Senior Age, libraries), but we could also potentially do this by email.

**Q: How will you promote the platform to the broader community?**
> **A:** [Same as previous answer - flyers and email]

### Integration & Partnerships

**Q: Should we integrate with existing community resources (food banks, social services)?**
> **A:** Yes! See separate Resources page document for the site.

**Q: Do you want connections to local churches, community centers, or nonprofits?**
> **A:** Not currently.

**Q: Any existing databases or systems we should connect with?**
> **A:** Maybe the background check program?

**Q: Interest in social media integration for community building?**
> **A:** Yes! I need to work on setting this up! I am trying to get a Work Study student for these kinds of tasks.

## 🎨 UI/UX Feedback

### Current Site Feedback

**Logo Size:**
> Could you make the logo on the landing page and the login page a bit larger? I'm thinking about twice the size of what it is now.

**Create Help Request Page:**
> On the Create Help Request page, the header is a bit cluttered. Will that all stay there?

**Overall:**
> I didn't spend tons of time in the sections requiring login, but I think it looks great from what I saw!
