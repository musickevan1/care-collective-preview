Hi Maureen,

Sounds great, thanks for the update! I’ll take a look at the additional colors you mentioned in Wix. Let me know when you’ve finalized them, and I’ll be sure to incorporate those into the branding pallet.

Best,  
Evan Musick

Hi Evan. I think the color palette you chose is very nice and similar to what I had started using when working on the site yesterday, but it started to look drab just using that range of colors, so I found some other colors that could be incorporated as well. If you go into the Design section of Wix, I think you can see what I was working on last night. Once I finalize the additional colors, I will email them to you as well.

Hi Maureen,

Great to hear from you, my week is going well, thanks! I received the invitation to collaborate on the new Wix site and the role of Website Designer works perfectly.

Congrats on securing the domain swmocarecollective.org, that is excellent news! Also, the logo looks great! I found and downloaded it from the Wix dashboard. Please feel free to explore and experiment with the templates. Let me know when you find any you particularly like or if you want feedback on specific options.

Thank you for sending over the initial ideas for the sections. These are very helpful as a starting point. Once you have additional content for those sections, please send it my way. I'll start structuring the site based on your notes and our project guidelines.

I've attached a design board that highlights a color palette that matches your logo. Let me know how you feel about these choices. I have also begun working on some low-fidelity wireframe mockups for the exchange platform, and will provide high-fidelity color versions soon.

Regarding the contact setup mentioned in your notes, creating a dedicated Gmail account would be a good idea for consistent and organized communication.

No worries about the Wix site switch, glad we are all set now!

I will try and get back to you soon with those proposed wireframes / mock-ups for you to view.

Looking forward to our continued progress!

Best,
