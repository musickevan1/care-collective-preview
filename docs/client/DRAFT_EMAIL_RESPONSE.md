Hi Maureen,

Thanks for sending over those documents and all the detailed information! I've spent some time going through everything and have put together a comprehensive plan to get us to production-ready.

## What I've Prepared

I've created a detailed production readiness plan that covers:

1. **Navigation & Content Updates** - All the new pages you requested (About Us, Resources, How It Works, etc.) with your mission, vision, and values content

2. **Resources Page Overhaul** - Complete restructure with the community resources you provided (SeniorAge, Ozarks Food Harvest, 211 Missouri, etc.)

3. **Help Request Categories** - Updated to the new 7-category structure you outlined (Health & Caregiving, Groceries & Meals, etc.)

4. **Advanced Features** - Request expiration system (30 days with "ongoing" option), impact tracking dashboard, geographic restrictions (30-mile radius), and liability waiver implementation

5. **Production Readiness** - Performance optimization, security hardening, comprehensive testing, and beta launch preparation

The full plan is broken down into manageable phases with estimated hours and costs. Total estimate is 60-76 hours ($2,700-3,800), but we can prioritize based on your budget and what's essential for beta launch.

## Important Notes

**Critical Issue First:** There's a security bug with the authentication system that needs to be fixed before we can safely proceed with anything else. It's about 4-6 hours of work and is currently blocking beta launch.

**Budget Questions:**
- The $350 from your Work Study redirect is great and can definitely help
- If there are additional funds from other categories, that would let us include more features
- We can take a phased approach if needed - core essentials first, then add features as budget allows

**Background Checks vs. Waivers:** You mentioned both - I'd recommend starting with a liability waiver (low cost, immediate) and we can add background check integration later if the community needs it. Happy to discuss pros/cons of each approach.

## Next Steps

Can we schedule a call to discuss:
1. Which features are must-haves for beta launch vs nice-to-haves?
2. Budget allocation and timeline
3. Your thoughts on waivers vs. background checks
4. Beta testing timeline - when are your 5 testers ready to start?

I'm excited about the progress and ready to get started as soon as we align on priorities!

Let me know what works for your schedule.

Best,
Evan

**P.S.** I made the logo 2x larger in the plan - it'll be 64px instead of 32px on the landing and login pages. Also cleaned up that cluttered help request header you mentioned. ðŸ˜Š
