# CARE Collective - Content & Questions for Evan

## Mission/Vision/Values

**Mission:** To connect caregivers with one another for the exchange of practical help, shared resources, and mutual support.

**Vision:** Reimagining caregiving as a collective act of compassion and mutual care that strengthens families and communities, supports dignity and well-being in later life, and makes caregiving sustainable for all.

**Values:**

- **Empowerment** - We build this collective by voicing our needs, cultivating confidence and growth, and shaping the support that works for us.
- **Compassion** – We act with kindness and empathy, honoring the dignity of caregivers and those they care for.
- **Reciprocity** – We value both giving and receiving support, recognizing that everyone contributes differently and all contributions strengthen our community.
- **Community** – We foster connections among caregivers and neighbors, creating belonging through shared experience and purpose.

## Why Join Section

The CARE Collective connects you with other caregivers who understand what you're going through and are ready to help and be helped.

As a member, you'll have access to:

- **Practical help when you need it** – Get support with respite, errands, paperwork, or just someone to check in.
- **Mutual exchange of support** – Caregivers helping each other meet real, practical needs. Give what you can, receive what you need. Everyone has something to offer and everyone needs help sometimes.
- **Flexibility that works for you** – Participate in ways that fit your schedule and capacity, whether that's offering a ride once a month or connecting for weekly check-ins.
- **Learning opportunities** – Attend workshops on topics that matter to you, from advance care planning to caregiver self-care.
- **No pressure, just support** – Feeling overwhelmed? Don't have much free time? Worried you don't have much to offer? You belong here, and it's okay to be in a season where you mostly need support.

Joining is simple. We'll help you get started, and you can participate in whatever ways work for your life right now.

## Questions from 9/24 Discussion

### What types of help requests do you want to encourage/discourage?

**Response:** See revised list above. I wouldn't encourage/discourage any of them specifically.

### How should we handle emergency or crisis situations?

**Response:** How would we find out about these? Or is that your question? What examples of this can you think of?

### What are your community standards for appropriate behavior?

**Community Standards**

Members of the CARE Collective agree to:

- Treat all caregivers with respect and avoid judgment or discrimination based on their situations, choices, or circumstances.
- Keep all shared information confidential and use member contact details only for CARE Collective exchanges.
- Honor commitments by communicating promptly if plans change or you're unable to follow through on an exchange.
- Respect each caregiver's limits around time, energy, and the type of support they can give or receive.
- Use the platform only to give or receive caregiving help and use good judgment about safety when meeting or exchanging with members.
- Avoid harassment or any behavior that undermines the safety or trust of the community.

**Terms of Use**

By joining the CARE Collective, you agree to follow these community standards and use the site responsibly. Membership may be paused or removed if behavior compromises the safety or trust of others.

**Privacy & Safety**

Your contact information is never shared publicly. If you have any concerns about safety or appropriate behavior, contact the CARE Collective administrator.

**Checkbox upon joining:** I agree to follow the CARE Collective's Community Standards, use the site responsibly, and respect the privacy and safety of all members.

### Should there be limits on how often someone can request help?

**Response:** I would say no off the bat. If something comes up, we can address it then.

### Do you want to verify community members somehow (address, phone, etc.)?

**Response:** If we required background checks for everyone, would this be necessary? Or could you see this taking the place of background checks for some tasks?

## 2. Help Request Categories

**Current Categories:** See revised list

**Questions:**

- **Are there specific categories important to Southwest Missouri we should add?**  
  **Response:** I don't think so as of now.

- **Should we include things like: yard work, pet care, technology help, job search assistance?**  
  **Response:** All except the final one.

- **Any categories you're concerned about from a liability perspective?**  
  **Response:** Did we talk about having them sign a waiver? I think that would be an important step.

## 3. Community Management

**Who will be the primary administrators?**  
**Response:** As of now, it will just be me and you.

**How quickly do you want to respond to reported problems?**  
**Response:** Maybe we could say, "Contact us at [email] with any concerns. We respond to safety issues within 24 hours and other inquiries within 2-3 business days."

**Should help requests expire after a certain time?**  
**Response:** I can't remember exactly what we discussed, but something along the lines of being able to mark a request as "ongoing" and otherwise expiring in 30 days, maybe with a reminder one week prior, if that's not too complicated.

**Do you want to track community impact (number of people helped, etc.)?**  
**Response:** Definitely!

## 4. Launch Strategy

**How many people do you want in the initial beta test?**  
**Response:** I've found 5 people to test it before it goes live. Then the grant says I will recruit 15-20 caregivers in the first year.

**Which communities should we start with? (Springfield, Branson, Joplin?)**  
**Response:** How about within a 30-mile radius from Springfield? How would we limit this, though? I wonder if we could add a feature that says something like, "Interested in CARE Collective expanding to your area? Enter your email so we can notify you."

**Do you have existing community groups we should invite first?**  
**Response:** I was thinking I would distribute flyers at various locations around town (senior centers, Senior Age, libraries), but we could also potentially do this by email.

**How will you promote the platform to the broader community?**  
**Response:** See previous answer.

---

## 5. Integration & Partnerships

**Should we integrate with existing community resources (food banks, social services)?**  
**Response:** Yes! See separate Resources page document for the site.

**Do you want connections to local churches, community centers, or nonprofits?**  
**Response:** Not currently.

**Any existing databases or systems we should connect with?**  
**Response:** Maybe the background check program?

**Interest in social media integration for community building?**  
**Response:** Yes! I need to work on setting this up! I am trying to get a Work Study student for these kinds of tasks.

## Maureen's Notes/Questions on Current Version of Site

- Could you make the logo on the landing page and the login page a bit larger? I'm thinking about twice the size of what it is now.

- For the top menu, let's have:
  - Home
  - What's Happening
  - How it Works
  - Resources (new page attached to email)
  - About Us (includes mission, vision, values, community standards, etc.)
  - Contact Us

- On the Create Help Request page, the header is a bit cluttered. Will that all stay there?

- I didn't spend tons of time in the sections requiring login, but I think it looks great from what I saw!
