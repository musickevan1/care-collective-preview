## üêõ If Issues Found

### Common Issues & Fixes

**Issue**: Login still fails with `verification_failed`
**Fix**: Check Vercel env vars, verify `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` exists

**Issue**: Messages don't load (PGRST116 error)
**Fix**: Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_MESSAGING_V2_ENABLED=true` in Vercel

**Issue**: WebSocket connection fails
**Fix**: Check Supabase realtime is enabled, verify session tokens

**Issue**: "Offer Help" doesn't create conversation
**Fix**: Check `create_conversation_atomic` RPC function exists

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check Vercel env vars
npx vercel env ls production

# Check Supabase connection
npm run db:types  # Should connect successfully

# View production logs
npx vercel logs care-collective-preview --prod

# Check deployment status
npx vercel inspect <deployment-url>
```
