**Subject**: Welcome to Care Collective Beta Testing! 🌱

Hi [TESTER_NAME],

Thank you for agreeing to be part of the Care Collective beta test! We're excited to have you help us build a platform that truly serves our community's needs.

## 🎯 What is Care Collective?

Care Collective is a mutual aid platform designed to connect community members who need help with those who can offer it. Whether it's groceries, transportation, household tasks, or medical support, our platform makes it easy to ask for and offer help in a safe, privacy-respecting way.

## 🔑 Your Beta Test Account

We've created an account for you with the following credentials:

**Platform URL**: https://care-collective-preview.vercel.app

**Your Credentials**:
- **Email**: [TESTER_EMAIL]
- **Password**: [GENERATED_PASSWORD]

**Important**: Please change your password after your first login! Go to your profile settings to update it.

Your account has been pre-approved, so you can start using the platform immediately - no waitlist!

## 📅 Beta Test Timeline

**Duration**: 2 weeks
**Start Date**: [START_DATE]
**End Date**: [END_DATE]

**Week 1 Focus**: Help requests and basic messaging
**Week 2 Focus**: Advanced features and privacy controls

## 🧪 What We Need From You

### Your Mission
Test the core functionality of the platform with a focus on:
1. **Creating and managing help requests**
2. **Offering help to others**
3. **Messaging and communication**
4. **Mobile experience** (please test on your phone!)

### How to Report Issues
We've added a **floating bug report button** to the platform - look for it in the bottom corner of every page. Use it whenever you find:
- Something that doesn't work
- Something confusing or unclear
- Something that could be better

Don't worry about being "too critical" - we want ALL your honest feedback!

### Surveys
You'll receive two brief surveys:
- **Mid-week check-in** (Day 3-4): Your first impressions
- **Final survey** (Day 13-14): Complete feedback

These should take less than 10 minutes each and are super helpful for us.
