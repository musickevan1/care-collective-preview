- [ ] Split up /about /contact /resources pages into sections Resources / About Us / Contact Us and place on the home page (if they are too long we can consider a preview section on home page then link to full section [ideally fit all on homepage though])
- [ ] Add terms of use / privacy & safety sections at bottom of homepage or link to them on footer
- [ ] Ensure scroll animation consistency with new sections
- [ ] Reorder navbar respectively
- [ ] Make "Join Our Community" button at the bottom of /home page visible with teal bg
- [ ] Add a X close button for the diagnostic mode debug panel to close
- [ ] Remove "Readable" button / feature
- [ ] Fix / clean up the Advanced filtering for requests
- [ ] When in the "New Request" page, the container to the right of the CARE Collective on the header shows the page endpoints as "/Help Requests / New Request " which is redundant, remove "/Help Requests" so it just shows "/New Request" and doesnt clutter the navbar
- [ ] On a users dashboard, let's add a section next to "Recent Community Activity" for users specific activity showing their current help requests
