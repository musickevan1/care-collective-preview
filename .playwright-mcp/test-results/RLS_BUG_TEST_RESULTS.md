# RLS Authentication Bug Fix - Production Test Results

**Test Date**: October 13, 2025
**Environment**: Production (https://care-collective-preview.vercel.app)
**Migration Tested**: `20251012000000_fix_profiles_rls_critical.sql`
**Test Duration**: 55 minutes

## 🧪 Detailed Test Results

### Test 1: Rejected User (CRITICAL)

**User**: `test.rejected.final@carecollective.test`

**Expected Behavior**:

## 🐛 Root Cause Analysis

### The Pattern

All users (rejected, pending, admin) see **"Test Approved User"** on the dashboard. This is NOT random - it's the first approved user in the database alphabetically by email.

```
test.approved.final@carecollective.test  <-- This user's data is shown to EVERYONE
```

### What's Happening

The RLS policy `"Users can view their own profile and approved users"` is:
1. ✅ **Working correctly** for the service role (middleware can check verification status)
2. ❌ **NOT working correctly** for client-side queries (dashboard page)
3. ❌ The dashboard page query is returning the FIRST approved user's profile instead of the authenticated user's profile

### The Query Problem

The issue is in `app/dashboard/page.tsx` (line 33 approximately):

```typescript
const { data: profile } = await supabase
  .from('profiles')
  .select('*')
  .single();
```

This query does NOT specify `WHERE id = auth.uid()` - it relies entirely on RLS to filter. But the RLS policy allows:
- ✅ User can view their own profile: `auth.uid() = id`
- ✅ Approved users can view other approved profiles

Without an explicit `WHERE id = auth.uid()`, the query returns the FIRST approved user's profile that passes RLS, not the authenticated user's profile!

## 🔐 Security Impact Assessment

### Critical Vulnerabilities

1. **Cross-User Data Access** (CRITICAL)
   - Rejected users can see approved user data
   - Pending users can see approved user data
   - Admin users see wrong user data

2. **Authorization Bypass** (CRITICAL)
   - Rejected users can access dashboard (should be blocked)
   - Pending users skip waitlist redirect

3. **Privacy Violation** (HIGH)
   - Users see other users' names
   - Users might see other users' help requests (needs verification)
   - Contact information exposure risk

### Working Security Features

1. ✅ Middleware correctly checks verification status for `/requests` route
2. ✅ Admin panel access control works (only admins can access)
3. ✅ Rejected users ARE blocked from `/requests` page
4. ✅ Authentication itself works (login/session management)

---

## 💡 Recommended Fixes

### Fix 1: Add Explicit WHERE Clause (IMMEDIATE)

**File**: `app/dashboard/page.tsx` (line ~33)

```typescript
// ❌ WRONG - Current code
const { data: profile } = await supabase
  .from('profiles')
  .select('*')
  .single();

// ✅ CORRECT - Add explicit WHERE clause
const { data: profile } = await supabase
  .from('profiles')
  .select('*')
  .eq('id', user.id)  // <-- Add this line
  .single();
```

### Fix 2: Add Middleware Protection for Dashboard

**File**: `middleware.ts`

Add `/dashboard` to the list of protected routes that check verification status:

```typescript
const protectedRoutes = ['/requests', '/dashboard', '/messages', '/admin'];
```

### Fix 3: Test the RLS Policy Fix

The RLS migration may not have been applied correctly. Verify:

```sql
SELECT policyname, cmd, qual::text
FROM pg_policies
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
AND tablename = 'profiles'
AND cmd = 'SELECT';
```

## 📊 Test Summary Statistics

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Total Tests | 4 user types |
| Critical Issues | 3 |
| High Priority Issues | 1 (admin wrong data) |
| Medium Priority Issues | 1 (500 error) |
| Tests Passed | 0 of 4 |
| Tests Failed | 4 of 4 |

## 🚀 Production Readiness Assessment

### Go/No-Go Decision: ❌ **NO-GO**

**Reasoning**:
The core security vulnerability (RLS authentication bug) is NOT resolved. Users can access data they shouldn't be able to see. This represents a critical privacy and security issue that blocks production deployment.

### Pre-Launch Checklist

- [ ] Fix dashboard query to use explicit WHERE clause
- [ ] Add middleware protection for `/dashboard` route
- [ ] Verify RLS policy was applied correctly
- [ ] Re-test all user types after fixes
- [ ] Verify 500 error is resolved
- [ ] Test contact information exposure risk
- [ ] Load test with multiple concurrent users

## 🔄 Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Before Next Deployment)

1. **Apply dashboard query fix** - Add explicit `WHERE id = user.id`
2. **Add dashboard middleware protection** - Block unapproved users
3. **Re-test on staging/local** - Verify fix before production
4. **Deploy fix to production** - Apply migration + code changes
5. **Re-run this test suite** - Confirm all issues resolved

### Investigation Required

1. **500 Error Analysis** - Determine cause of server error (likely related to RLS query)
2. **Help Request Data Access** - Test if rejected users can view help request details
3. **Contact Information Exposure** - Verify contact exchange privacy is intact
4. **Performance Impact** - Check if RLS policy affects query performance

## 📝 Technical Notes

### Database Observations

- All 4 test accounts exist in production database
- Verification statuses are correctly set
- Admin flag is correctly set for admin user
- No missing data in profiles table

### Browser Console Errors

- **500 Error**: Occurs for both approved and admin users
- URL pattern: `https://kecureoyekeqhrxkmjuh.supabase.co/rest/v1/...`
- Likely an RLS-related query failure

### Middleware Behavior

- ✅ `/requests` route correctly checks verification status
- ❌ `/dashboard` route does NOT check verification status
- ✅ `/admin` route correctly checks admin status
